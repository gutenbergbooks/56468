<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In the summer of last year (1889), I first heard
of the authoress of this autobiography: not
accidentally, as some might put it, but rather by
the good providence of Jehovah, who “worketh all
things after the counsel of His own will.”</p>

<p>Ex-sister Mary Agnes, or Miss J. M. Povey,
had been attending one of Mrs. Edith O’Gorman
Auffray’s (better known as “The Escaped Nun”)
lectures at the Town Hall, Kensington, and after
the lecture she obtained an interview with the
lecturess, during which she gave her a short account
of her own experiences in convents nominally connected
with the Church of England. The following
day I happened to meet Mrs. Auffray, who passed
on to me what Miss Povey had told her. I at once
made up my mind to request this lady, if possible,
to publish her experiences, and I wrote a letter to
her offering any assistance in my power, if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
entertained the idea of making her experiences
more widely known.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned that Mrs. Auffray had
recommended Miss Povey to communicate with
me, and had urged upon her the importance of
bearing witness to the merciful deliverance God
had vouchsafed to her.</p>

<p>I feel bound, therefore, to express to Mrs.
Auffray my thanks for the good advice she gave
Miss Povey; and let me say here that though
perhaps no woman has been more vilified, and
persecuted, by the Roman Catholics, and I fear
too by many Ritualists and weak, half-hearted
Protestants, than has Mrs. Auffray, yet no woman
has been more blessed by God in exposing the
errors of Romanism. To my mind, it is as easy
to prove the perfect veracity of Mrs. Auffray’s
story, told with such power, as it is to prove that
once Queen Elizabeth reigned in England, or that
the Duke of Wellington led his soldiers to victory
when the battle of Waterloo was fought. I had
not long to wait before receiving from Miss Povey
a small portion of her manuscript; and, being
struck with the unaffected style, and genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
appearance of the story thus commenced, I consented
at her request to correct and revise, or, in
one word, to edit, the whole of the material she
might feel disposed to place in my hands.</p>

<p>I need hardly say, considering the many other
engagements devolving upon the vicar of a parish
of 20,000 people, that I have been obliged to make
a somewhat slow progress with the work, short
though it may appear, and when I had come to the
close of it, I could not but feel that the book was
worthy of an editor who could have devoted more
time, attention and talent to it, than it was within
my reach to do.</p>

<p>I would acknowledge here, with a feeling of deep
gratitude, the assistance given me towards the
close of my editorial duties, in connection with the
book, by a gentleman whose name I am not at
liberty to divulge. This gentleman introduced the
manuscript to the publishers, and he has most
kindly cast his eye carefully over the whole work,
correcting or rescinding where he thought it advisable.
Perhaps there are few men in England who
know more than he does on the subject of English
sisterhoods. He has lectured with ability on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
subject, and is likely to become ere long a well-known
writer. Since I made him acquainted with
the work I was editing, and had had some conversation
with him upon these matters, I only wished
he had taken my place as editor.</p>

<p>I think that those who read through this book
will readily acknowledge that Miss Povey has done
her work well, and I feel sure she will receive the
hearty congratulations of a great number of persons.
She has been obliged to write under some
considerable disadvantages, arising from the nature
of her employment, which does not allow a very
wide margin of time for writing; consequently, as
she reminded me, she has had no time to look
over and correct what force of circumstances compelled
her to write somewhat hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I shall be much obliged,” she has written to
me, “for any improvement you think fit to make,
in correcting, revising, rescinding, in all the manuscript.”
Any excellence that may be found in the
book must be wholly due to the authoress; none
could have written in the forcible and graphic way
she has done, who had not herself passed through
so strange and painful an experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>I have only had one interview with Miss Povey,
and <em>that</em> when the book was well nigh finished.
But before then I took great pains to find out
the thorough trustworthiness of her antecedents
and statements. God forbid that I should ever
venture to send before the public a work of such
deep import, were I not perfectly convinced that
ex-sister Mary Agnes was in a position to write,
and actually was writing, the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>I have by me a letter written by the Mother
Abbess of the Feltham convent, to the lady in
whose employment Miss Povey is now living, giving
her, as will be acknowledged by all, a very
high character for truthfulness and uprightness.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Convent, Feltham</span>,<br />
<i>Sept. 14th, 1887</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,—</p>

<p>Miss J. M. Povey lived in my house for ten years,
and I knew of her before and since.</p>

<p>She bears, and has always borne, the highest moral character;
all her relations are highly respectable people. She
is thoroughly conscientious and trustworthy, clever and
observant, and speaks well. She is a good needlewoman,
and I should think quite capable of undertaking what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
require of her, and is one who would do her work quite as
well in your absence as if you were at home superintending
her.</p>

<p>She is <em>quite above</em> the ordinary station of domestic servants.
There is no mystery in her life.</p>

<p class="center">I am, dear Madam, yours truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mary Hilda</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Miss Povey has also received the two following
letters from the same lady:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Convent, Feltham</span>,<br />
<i>Feb. 15th, 1886</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Poor dear Child</span>,—</p>

<p>I am not in the least surprised at your leaving, and
I pity you much for several reasons.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mary Hilda.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Convent, Feltham</span>,<br />
<i>Feb. 20th, 1886</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dearest Child</span>,—</p>

<p>However good F. Ignatius may be (and he has
much goodness), I never thought he had much tact; but that
he could be so utterly devoid of it as to tell M. Wereburgh
that you knew about her history after leaving here first time,
I could not have imagined. Of course, knowing her as I
did, I can but feel sure that she was anxious for you to leave,
lest you should hint it to others. I am, as I have said, very
sorry for you, and hope you will not stay in the world.</p>

<p class="center">Your always sincere friend, and
affectionate Sp. Mother,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mary Hilda</span>, M. Sup.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>I have ample testimony to the truth of her statement,
“<em>Seventeen</em> Years with Father Ignatius,” since
I am able to give the following extract from a
letter written by “Ignatius” himself to Sister
Mary Agnes, soon after she had left the convent:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jesus <img src="images/cross.jpg" width="35" height="50" alt="†" style="position: relative; top: 1.5em;" /> Only</span>.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Pax.</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Llanthony Abbey</span>,<br />
<i>Dec. 30th, 1884</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dearest Child</span>,—</p>

<p>… You have profited nothing from all my
teaching and patience of nearly seventeen years: you cannot
imagine the grief you have given me.</p>

<p>I have no time for more. I shall always pray for you, and
love you, and you must think of me as always</p>

<p class="center">Your affectionate, but disappointed Father,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ignatius</span>, O.S.B.</p>

</div>

<p>Most of the readers of this book will probably
know the meaning of the letters “O.S.B.” They
mean the “Order of St. Benedict.” Now, although
Sister Mary Agnes never became what is
called in conventual phraseology a “<em>professed</em>”
nun in that Order, that is to say, she never “took
the black veil,” yet for all these years she was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
<em>novice nun</em>, and was always looked upon and called
a <em>nun</em>.</p>

<p>In a letter Father Ignatius wrote to her in the
year 1879, whilst she was in the convent, this sentence
occurs: “You are really a little <em>nun</em>”; and
again: “If I find you really grown in a nun-like
spirit, I really hope we may fix (D.V.) your profession,
say, this year.”</p>

<p>I might very easily add more to prove that this
simple story of seventeen years of convent life is
not a fabricated one, but the evidence I have produced,
out of a mass which I have at my disposal,
will surely be enough.</p>

<p>Miss Povey has decided to make known her life
as a nun, in order that others may take warning,
and profit by her experiences. No young lady
who may become acquainted with this book can
ever say, should she be deluded into taking the
veil, that she took that terrible leap, as I fear many
do take it, in the dark.</p>

<p>Convents, or sisterhoods, in connection with the
Church of England, are by no means few and far
between, and it is to be hoped that this book
will bring conviction to many of the transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
fact, that the teaching and practices within their
walls are not so widely different from the same
within the walls of Roman Catholic convents.</p>

<p>I hope that Miss Povey’s work may do good in
making known the danger of being misled by
the <em>apparently</em> pure evangelical teaching which
Father Ignatius is said to give. Now, it seems to
me, that here in this book we have the means of
subjecting this specious-looking metal to a severe
test. His so-called Gospel sermons and orations
contain some good metal with which the counterfeit
coin is covered and made to pass as genuine.</p>

<p>It is an incumbent duty to let her revelations be
known far and wide, so that souls be not led astray.</p>

<p>Is there not a cause? Consider it, I beg of
you, who may read this book. Remember that
with scarcely an exception (I don’t think the infallibility
of the Pope is acknowledged in these
convents) every Roman Catholic tenet is unblushingly
held and taught in the three convents which
this book refers to. Roman Catholic literature of
the most advanced type is constantly used in
them.</p>

<p>Another advantage that I hope and feel sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
will arise from studying this little book, will be
found in the remarkably clear definition Miss
Povey has been enabled to give of the three
celebrated and essentially Romish <em>vows</em> of poverty,
chastity, and obedience. These self-same vows
are just now being spoken of a good deal, and
many are telling us that they are to be an essential
element in the new brotherhoods which the
Bishop of Rochester has so lately, in the Upper
House of Convocation and in his Triennial Charge,
advocated. I cannot but hope that God has raised
up, at a most opportune moment, a witness against
the imposition of such vows, whether on men or
women. I hope it may lead those who are favourable
to the scheme to favour it no more. Is it
not palpable to all that just as sisterhoods are
made the secret repositories of extreme Romish
education, practices, and literature, so likewise will
brotherhoods be made to serve a similar purpose?</p>

<p>We are certainly living in “perilous times,” and
it is amazing to behold the spirit of indifference
in quarters where we might least expect it, not
only with regard to the great strides Ritualism is
making, so that Protestant Evangelicalism is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
nigh eclipsed, but this indifference is as great with
regard to the advance of Romanism and Jesuitism,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and (saddest result of all) to the building
of so many hundreds of Roman Catholic convents
and monasteries in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>There are in existence societies for the prevention
of cruelty to children, and for the prevention
of cruelty to animals; but although the cruelties
and tortures, called penances, which are inflicted
on many a poor helpless nun are greater than
those inflicted on animals, the man who raises
up his voice against this worst form of inhumanity
is counted unloving and bigoted. Believe
me, the unloving ones are those who lend
any countenance whatever to, or who do not make
a righteous protest against, the conventual and
monastic <em>system</em>, according to which disciplines,
hair-shirts, scourgings, and various other forms of
cruelty and degradation are employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>Do we not see that, if this system is allowed
to advance in the Church of England, these very
penances (many of which <em>do</em> exist, all of which
<em>may</em> exist, in the Church of England convents),
which, without any doubt, exist in Romish convents,
will be inflicted with equal severity in
English Church convents.</p>

<p>Sister Mary Agnes does not speak of prison-like
underground cells in Father Ignatius’s convents,
and we believe, therefore, that anyhow at present
they do not exist in them. But she does speak
of penances, and she has felt them.</p>

<p>In bringing my Preface to a close, I will give
a statement with regard to the Church of England
convent in Woodstock Road, in the City of Oxford,
founded by the late Dr. Pusey. This statement
has been made by a clergyman of the Established
Church, who is perfectly prepared, if need be, to
give his name.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In the summer of 1866, I was travelling from Oxford
to London, and there happened to be in the same railway
carriage one of the leading tradesmen in the city of
Oxford.</p>

<p>Our conversation turned upon the advances which
Romanism was apparently making in the United Kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
and conspicuously by the influence of a certain section now
well known as Ritualists in our own Church.</p>

<p>He asked me if I had noticed a building which was being
erected in “The Parks” (Oxford), and whether I was aware
that owing to a clause in the lease of the ground, and some
complications arising therefrom, the owners of the edifice
had determined even, if necessary, to surrender the lease,
and transfer the materials to a freehold site in another part
of the city? I remarked that such a course looked suspicious,
made my own comments on it, and, when opportunity
offered, acted.</p>

<p>During a stay in Oxford a few days subsequently, I went
one afternoon to see for myself, and on coming to the building,
asked the clerk of the works, or foreman, if I might look
round it. Having done so, I found the fabric almost completed,
but was struck by an apparent loss of space owing
to the height of the walls from the ground, without any
ostensible object. I observed a small door, directly underneath
the main entrance, and on examination found it padlocked,
but seeing that the staple was not clenched, I
removed it with the point of my umbrella, and thus gained
entrance to what proved to be a long corridor, right and left
of which <em>cells</em> were erected, but not completed.</p>

<p>As rapidly as I could I took a general survey of the
whole arrangements, replaced the staple and padlock, and
before leaving expressed my best thanks to the foreman,
who was engaged with some workmen in a shed at the
entrance to the premises, erected quite apart from the
building.</p>

<p>I then talked with him about the peculiar construction
of the building, and asked him why the walls were built so
as to leave a great space between the foundations and first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
floor. He stated that this was for <em>the purpose of ventilation</em>
only. I then remarked that it was unusual to see buildings
so constructed, and then I said, “Was that all?” He volunteered
the statement that there was nothing in this space
underneath the fabric but the external walls. Happening to
know differently, I drew my own conclusions, and left.—(Signed) ⸺.</p>

</div>

<p>Finally, let us hope that God’s people throughout
England will make it a matter of daily intercession
to the throne of Grace that convents,
whether Anglican or Roman Catholic, may be
utterly abolished. I sincerely trust that this book
will be read as a witness of what God’s good providence
and sovereign grace have done for the writer
of this interesting narrative, and therefore can do
for others. May the Spirit of the living God that
opened the eyes of Sister Mary Agnes, be poured
out abundantly to open the eyes of many in this
land, who are sitting in darkness and the shadow
of death. And may they be led, by the same
Spirit, through the one only Mediator between
God and man, even Jesus Christ, to obtain fellowship
with the Father, together with all other
spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus, “according as
God hath chosen us in Him before the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
of the world.” And, finally, may He also enable
them to “stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ
hath made them free.”</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In sending forth this book to the world, I would
have it clearly understood that it is not my
desire to injure any one. I only wish that <em>the
mistakes of my life</em> may prove a warning to others
and prevent them from taking the step I did. I
feel it to be a solemn duty, which I owe to God,
to put before the public convent life in the Church
of England, as I found it.</p>

<p>Naturally I shrink from the task, for the Mother
of the Feltham convent has always acted, as far
as my experience goes, conscientiously, and it was
in no way on her account that I felt bound to
withdraw from convent life. Besides Father
Ignatius himself <em>once</em> seemed to love me as his
“little daughter,” and was exceedingly kind to me.
Let it be remembered that I was <em>then</em> but a child
and a very simple and inexperienced one.</p>

<p>In one sense, it is not against him personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
that I am writing, yet, in another, it is, because
he was head over all, added to which, he made
a personal application to my mother to give me
up to him for God’s service, and thus he was
responsible for seeing that my life was made at
least endurable; instead of which, he gave me
up entirely into the hands of a certain Mother
Superior, who (I would speak the truth in love)
was a zealous and tyrannical woman.</p>

<p>Believing it, then, to be my duty, I now take up
my pen, and may God guide it, so that, in His
hands, it may be the means of saving young girls
and women, and young men and boys, from
inflicting on their relatives the bitter pain and
sorrow which I caused my own dear mother and
friends. May many by this warning be saved
from the bitter disappointment which was my lot,
when I found convent life <em>so</em> different in practice
and reality from what in theory and fancy it
seemed to be. Instead of it being the “Gate of
Heaven,” as it is sometimes said to be, my
experience was that it is much nearer another
gate.</p>

<p>I feel convinced too that, if the truth could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
be got at, it would be discovered that my
experience was not an exceptional one. I have
heard that it was St. Chrysostom who said, “A
monk, by the very nature of the life he leads, is
either an angel or a devil,” and I seldom, if ever,
knew a monk or boy, a girl or woman, who, sooner
or later, did not turn into something which was
far removed from that which is angelic, though at
their entrance into that name of “Pax,” they were,
to all appearances, “perfect saints.”</p>

<p>Instead of being ennobled by the monastic and
conventual life, my experience has been (and I
have had an experience of some seventeen years,
and have come in contact with a goodly number
of persons living under vows) that the life is far
from having an ennobling influence. Life of this
kind generally causes those who lead it to become
mean, petty, and selfish, and no selfishness can
equal a nun’s, particularly when nature inclines
her to be so.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Nuns are either crushed slaves <em>or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
tyrants</em>, and often so puffed up with pride that
they look upon “seculars” as a race of beings
far below themselves, and who, as the Lady
Prioress Wereburgh used to say to us, “should
think themselves highly honoured to have the
privilege of a nun condescending to speak to
them.”</p>

<p>I would ask all who read this story to overlook
the lack of style and order which may be apparent,
but I am now very much occupied in earning
my bread, and can only give a few night-hours
occasionally to the task, and I have never been
accustomed to work of this kind.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>MY REASONS FOR BECOMING A SISTER.</i></span></h2>

<p>From the earliest time that my memory goes
back, I loved Jesus, though I knew very
little about Him—only what my dear mother
taught me, and she was what is termed a “shy
Christian.” But I often wished that people would
talk more about Him, at least to me; and as a
little girl I used to look at people, and wish they
would speak to me of Jesus, though I was too
timid to put my thoughts into words.</p>

<p>When I was about fourteen years of age, in the
year 1868, there was a great stir about a new
preacher who preached at several city churches,
including St Edmund’s, Lombard Street, and St.
Ethelburga’s, Bishopsgate. His name was Father
Ignatius; he was a Church of England clergyman,
and called himself a monk. At that period I
happened to be on a visit to my aunt, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
sister wrote and told me that Father Ignatius
preached monasticism, that he had a monastery
and would soon open a convent. I remember
how I thought everybody was turning to Roman
Catholicism; and I made up my mind not to go
near this strange man. So at first I would not
go to hear him, though somehow I was very
anxious to see him. At last my mother persuaded
me to go, and I heard him preach the love of
Jesus as I had never before heard it. I recollect
how my mother presented me to him, and how
he took my hand, and said, “God bless you, dear
child!” Though he said neither more nor less
I was won, and from that moment I felt compelled
to dwell on all his doings, and to drink in his
words. What extraordinary power, or <em>mesmerism</em>,
is it that this man possesses, enabling him to
exert such an influence, not only over a simple
child, but also over young and old, man and
woman, noble and peasant? How often have I
asked myself this question, yet in the course of
twenty years I have not solved the mystery! But
does he retain the friendship of those he wins?
For a short time he does, but as a rule they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
eventually turn away from him, and sometimes
even become his greatest enemies; for he possesses
a strange power not only of winning love, but also
of casting it away from him when won.</p>

<p>But I have somewhat departed from my story,
which I will now resume. I remember being in
church one evening, and we sang the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The love of Jesus, what it is</div>
<div class="verse">None but His loved ones know.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I thought to myself, “Who are His loved ones?”
Day after day I went about wondering who they
were. I would look into every face I met, but the
love of Jesus did not seem to me stamped there;
yet I was determined to find out, for, I said to
myself, “I <em>must</em> be His loved one!” At last I
saw a gentle, pale-faced sister; and she looked so
good and pure (my favourite text was, “Blessed
are the pure in heart”) that a sudden thought
flashed into my mind that it was these sisters, or
nuns, who were the “loved ones,” and that therefore
I must be a sister. But I was not bold
enough to tell any one my thoughts, besides which
I thought I was very much too young to be a nun.
I recollect that just at this time I went to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
private meetings,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> held by certain sisters, and one
of them asked me, on one of these occasions,
“Should you like to be a sister?” My heart
jumped on hearing the question, and I replied,
“Yes.” No more was said then; but when I again
went, Father Ignatius asked me the same question,
and I made the same reply as before. He then
told me to ask my mother to allow me to be
“<em>given to God</em>” as a nun. Of course my mother
would not hear of it, and only laughed at me, and
called me “a goose to want to shut myself away
from mother and everybody.” The idea, however,
had so taken possession of me, that I begged over
and over again to be allowed to go; but my
mother would not give her consent. Every time
Father Ignatius saw me he asked if I had obtained
my mother’s consent, and I was obliged to say
“No.” One day, I remember, he said to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
“Well, ask your mother to let you <em>go for a month
on a visit</em>!” I dared not ask her for a month,
knowing she would not grant me so long a time,
so I asked her to let me go for a week, and after
considering my request for two days, she told me
I might go for a week. I therefore went for that
period. I was fifteen years of age then; and the
convent was at Feltham, where I stayed for ten
years. But before the week had expired, I asked
for another week, saying I was so happy in this
new life. To my request she made answer,
“Another week, but not a day over.” During this
week the Father called upon my mother, and
persuaded her to “give me to God.” Very reluctantly
she gave her consent, as she told me,
“for one year, to sicken you of it, and you will
soon be glad to come back home to your mother.”
No one but God ever knew for years after how I
longed to get back to my mother, though I dared
not allow it even to myself. When my mother
gave me up, she had Father Ignatius’s promise not
to let me take life-vows until I was twenty-one
or twenty-five years of age.</p>

<p>The first year passed away very happily. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
young; and being small in stature, I was made a
pet of, until another young sister came. Then the
Mother changed, and she who had so petted me
suddenly took a dislike to me; not that she was
so very unkind. But how I yearned to be loved!
No one seemed to love me, and I loved her, oh,
so much! When I went up to her and said,
“Mother, dear,” instead of opening her arms, and
folding me in them as she used to do, she would
turn away with a shudder. Why she did this, I
never knew. I could not fail to feel surprise at
it, as she had often taught me that “a spiritual
father’s, and mother’s, and sister’s love is far
greater than that of any earthly parents.” I was
sure my mother would never thus turn away from
me. Oh, how keenly I felt this coldness! and
when I went to bed, I would cry and sob for hours,
knowing that no one in that house loved me, and
my heart seemed fit to break at such a loveless
life. My mother’s smile, her words, and her every
look and action, would rise up before me. I remembered
my sister and dear little brother, both
of whom I so fondly loved, and I would think,
“Oh! if it was not wicked of me, I wish I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
home”; but I would then blame myself for thinking
thus, for I considered it showed unfaithfulness
to God to allow such thoughts even for a moment,
and I was afraid lest God should take my “holy
vocation” from me, and I would also remember
how God would have His spouse forsake all other
love that she may love Him, and be His alone.</p>

<p>Was there ever a more cruel and bitter mistake?
Cruel is the teaching which requires a young girl
to separate herself from the dear good mother,
whom God has given her, in order that she may,
as is falsely said, serve God without hindrance.
What folly and delusion is it that takes possession
of us, to think that we can get nearer to God, be
more pure, more holy in this life, and be brought
to greater glory in the next life, by shutting oneself
up in a particular house and never going out
except to the garden, I cannot fathom!</p>

<p>Listen to the text which brings us up to this
unnatural life, or, as we were told, this “supernatural
life.” “A garden inclosed is My sister,
My spouse; a spring shut up,” etc. Year after
year this text bears us up, coupled with the
thought that such a life is only a short time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
comparison with eternity, when we shall reap the
great reward of our life of self-sacrifice. Blinder
than the very heathen was I!</p>

<p>Sometimes I would stand and look around that
small enclosure and think, “Shall I never in this
life go farther than this garden surrounded with
trees?” Often my brain seemed to turn at the
very thought. If only I could have seen a great
space, or a great sea, it would be better; but there
were those trees in a flat country, and nothing
beyond (a true type indeed). But then I would
come back to my text, as above quoted, and think
that as God is pleased with me, nothing else is of
consequence. So I went on year after year, anything
but happy, yet not <em>daring</em> to let myself think
of turning back. Often did I <span class="smcapuc">LONG</span> to speak of
mother and of the dear ones at home, but I could
not without breaking the rule, “never to speak
of our earthly relations except to God in prayer.”
If we broke this rule, we had to confess it the same
day, and perform the prescribed penance of losing
the hour’s recreation, do some menial work, and
keep silence during the only hour we had set
apart for conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of my first year my mother wrote
to Father Ignatius demanding me back. She
wrote to me at the same time, telling me she was
coming to fetch me; but the Father gave me no
advice on the subject, and I could have gone back
as far as consent from my superiors went. At
that time they gave me my mother’s letter, which
of course they had read (all letters are read by the
Mother first); but what about the teaching and
instruction that had gone before? What about
the awful words I had heard that, “should I ever
even look back, I should then be unmeet for the
kingdom of God”? What about the example of
Lot’s wife, so often set before us? She only
<em>looked</em> back, and how terrible the <em>immediate</em> result!
What would happen (I thought) to one espoused
to Christ, if she not only looked back, but deliberately
turned from the “path that leads to
life,” as we were instructed? Not even for one
second did I <em>dare</em> to allow myself to think it. I
would not go back, and did not.</p>

<p>My mother waited another year, and came this
time to the convent without writing, so that
I might not be influenced beforehand. Oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
mothers, little do you know the influence that is
always at work: and yet your children dare not
even wish to tell you, for it would be a terrible
sin to tell even you anything about that influence,—it
would be a grave scandal to do so. But it
is equally a great sin to hide anything from our
<em>Superior</em>; we are distinctly told never to conceal
anything, not even our most secret thoughts, from
our Superior. Should we have a great temptation
to leave the life we had entered on, or any
great temptation to rebel against convent rules,
we were expressly told to make it known at once,
that we might have the benefit of our Superior’s
advice. Remember, too, that self-examination
comes three times a day!</p>

<p>One morning, at the Communion, the Father
suddenly turned round, saying:</p>

<p>“If any sister in this chapel has one single unfaithful
thought of going back to the world, <em>I dare</em>
her to come to this altar, and touch with her lips
the sacred Body and Blood of her God. ‘Woe
be to him through whom the offence cometh!’”</p>

<p>We were all startled, and I said,“Lord, is it I?”
But it was not me, for I would rather have suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
torture than commit so great a sin. A certain
lay-sister stayed behind at that time, and I asked
her, when the next opportunity offered itself to
me, if she had thoughts of looking back? She
replied:</p>

<p>“I told the reverend Father last night, I thought
I ought to go home to my father to keep house
for him, as my mother was dead.”</p>

<p>The reader will perceive that though we were
not shut in by literal bolts and bars, we were
bound by something very, very much more
effectual—even by the nameless and unexplainable
fear of being guilty of the <em>terrible sin</em> of
going back to the world. How fearfully real and
effectual is this feeling!</p>

<p>My mother and sister then came to fetch me,
and I was sent alone into the parlour, that they
might see how little I was <em>apparently</em> influenced
by any outside pressure, and that I might tell
them that I had a wish of my own free will to
remain in the convent. At this interview, some
one, unknown to my mother, was, of course, within
earshot, according to rule; but I did not fear that,
for I had no intention of going back, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
losing the virgin’s crown in heaven, which I so
much coveted, and which could only be obtained,
as I then supposed, by remaining true to my holy
calling. My sister was evidently exercising great
self-restraint at this interview, and could scarcely
refrain from weeping; my own mother sobbed, and
my heart was wrung, and yet I dared not think of
going home. Almost choking with emotion, and
stretching out my arms and folding them around
my mother’s neck, I gasped:</p>

<p>“Mother, darling, I <span class="smcapuc">DO</span> love you; but I belong
to God, and I <em>dare</em> not go back.”</p>

<p>Tears blind me, even now while I write, as I
think of that <em>awful</em> struggle, which I had been
taught was right and pleasing to God. At last
my mother was able to speak, and she said:</p>

<p>“This is the second time I have tried to get you
away, and you refuse to come. Now, mind, I
shall never come to see you again, or write to you,
but you will live to repent the day you ever shut
yourself up in a convent, and remember that I
will have nothing more to do with you while you
are here; but if ever you should want a home,
while I have one, it is yours also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>She went on to say:</p>

<p>“Father Ignatius will get tired of you some
day, then what will you do if your mother is no
more?”</p>

<p>My reply was (remembering what a great pet
he made of me, and also how I had read and been
told that “the love of spiritual parents was so
much stronger than that of any earthly parent”):</p>

<p>“You are, dear mother, very kind; but I am
sure the reverend Father will never change.”</p>

<p>And so I truly thought.</p>

<p>This wrench from all home-ties well nigh broke
my heart; yet I dared not even think of leaving
the convent, though in my heart of hearts I deeply
wished I had never taken up that “golden plough.”
Ah! had I only not taken it up, there would have
been no sin in wishing for home again; but now it
was far different, for it seemed to me, at the time,
that in God’s great goodness the path had been
shown to me down which I must walk, and that I
must with determination choose the good, and cast
aside every thought of returning to the world.
And so I chose what I had been taught was the
good, and no one until now knows the bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
struggle I passed through. How often did I recall
this day, or rather I could not drive it from my
memory whilst sleeping or waking! It often drove
sleep from my eyes, and my constant thought was,
“If only I could put my arms round my mother’s
neck, and kiss her just once more!”</p>

<p>At last all was arranged for me to take the
black veil, and I even had orders to write for my
mother to come and see this imposing ceremony,
as it is really a novice’s entire <em>death</em> to the world,
and we are allowed to see our nearest relative
before we die. I was told I might go into the
visitor’s room to see my mother if she came; but
though my Superior said it was <em>lawful</em> to see her,
yet she <em>advised me not to go</em>, as it might prove a
cause of great distraction. When I was first told I
might go into the room where my mother was to
come, my heart leaped for joy. “Now,” I thought,
“I shall be able to kiss her once again.” But then
I remembered all the advice I had been given,
and I wanted to be “perfect”; so, for the love of
Jesus, as <em>I thought</em>, I gave up the privilege and joy
of kissing my own dear mother!</p>

<p>As a rule, we only saw friends behind the grille,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with a third person, who must be a professed nun,
to listen and report us should we make a slip
in our conversation, or scandalize a secular by
repeating anything that should not be told.</p>

<p>However, after all, my taking the black veil and
thus becoming a professed nun was put off, as the
superiors could not agree as to what place I was to
take in the community. The reverend Mother
wished me to keep where I was—the reverend
Father wished me to be raised above six or seven
who were older, and had been professed some years
back. Since neither would waive their wishes, I
had to wait, and consequently, I never took the
black veil, or <em>life</em>-vows, and <em>never</em> saw my mother
again, as when I left convent life she was not alive.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>CONVENT LIFE ENTERED UPON.</i></span></h2>

<p>In the beginning of November, 1868, I went on
a short visit to the “Benedictine convent of
cloistered nuns,” at Feltham. Father Ignatius,
who claims to be the father, founder, and reviver
of monasticism in the Church of England, had
turned an old farm-house at Feltham into a
convent.</p>

<p>The “rule” given to the nuns by him can be
procured at any Roman Catholic publishers. It is
entitled “The Holy Rule of St. Benedict, translated
by a Priest of Mount Melleray.” There are
other translations of the rule, but this one is much
more strict than any other which I have read.</p>

<p>After a time Father Ignatius gave us forty-nine
observances to keep. These were really much
stricter than the rule itself, and they were to be
read every day, and the least transgression had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
be written down and sent in to our Superior at the
close of each week, in addition to the usual confession
to a priest. The Feltham Mother never
wished us to make a confession to her, though the
Mother at Llanthony insisted upon everything
being disclosed to her.</p>

<p>To these forty-nine observances, later on, were
added about forty-nine more, so that we were
hedged all round by them, sleeping or waking.
Transgressions of these observances were “convent
sins.” I have already related how my visit for a
week was soon lengthened out, and I will not
particularize those first and early experiences.</p>

<p>It was in February, 1869, that I was received
into Feltham convent as a postulant. There is a
form to go through when a postulant is received.
The Superior asks:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What dost thou desire of us?</p>

<p><i>Postulant.</i>—To be admitted into the house of God.</p>

<p><i>Superior.</i>—None can enter our gates but such as seek to
be the spouse of the Lamb.</p>

<p><i>Postulant.</i>—I postulate for the habit of the heavenly
espousals in the Holy Order of St. Benedict.</p>

<p><i>Superior.</i>—Dost thou promise to obey the rules?</p>

<p><i>Postulant.</i>—I do.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few more questions and answers, I was
properly made a postulant, and thought myself at
heaven’s gate.</p>

<p>On April 13th, two months after my reception
as a postulant, I took, as a novice, the three conventual
vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.
I would remind those of my readers who may be
ignorant of these things, that whilst the vow of
obedience is put last in order, yet it is of the first
importance. I remember well the day I took
these vows. I was attired in white, and wore a
bridal veil and wreath. I recollect that another
girl (Florence S⸺ by name) stood with me—I
should rather say knelt. Together we waited
to sacrifice ourselves upon the altar of God,—not
by the sacrificial knife, that would be but
the work of a few seconds—but by the daily and
hourly sacrifice of everything that we loved.</p>

<p>When some of the difficulties and trials of my
new life were set before me, I had no fears. I was
in a state of high joy at the thought which had
been burnt into my soul, viz., that I was espoused
to the King of kings, and that I was the Lamb’s
bride now and for ever. How could fear ruffle my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
spirit whilst under this spell? Besides, how should
a girl of my age (I was but fifteen at this time)
have any notion of what sorrow, and trial, and
trouble meant, especially, as was the case with me,
when an affectionate mother had lovingly and
carefully concealed from me any evils that might
come in after years?</p>

<p>The anticipation of any evil in the future seemed,
however, to fade into insignificance, since I was
uplifted above terrestrial things by—I really know
not how best to describe it—by the thought of
Him whom I regarded as my heavenly Lover.
Never did any girl or woman love her lover or her
husband more than I did the Lord Jesus Christ,
whose bride I <em>thought</em> myself to be, <em>because</em> I had
taken those three vows of poverty, chastity, and
obedience. I sometimes felt as if I must die; so
overpowered was I with love that I could scarcely
breathe.</p>

<p>Often since that time have I asked myself,
“What was it that I so loved?” If it had been the
love of the heavenly Bridegroom, that seemed as it
were to saturate me, would that sister who knelt
at my side on this occasion have been permitted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
after years to make my life such a misery to me,
that I could no longer live a cloistered life? What
or who it was I know not; all I know is that whoever
or whatever it was, it obtained possession of
my first love—the undivided love of my whole
being; but that love is gone, and I do not think
I could ever love with the same full, pure, and
intense love again. That love, fixed on a lover
existing only in the imagination, and impressed on
my plastic and youthful mind, carried me through
a convent experience lasting for seventeen years.
And then it vanished. The illusion was dissipated,
the <i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> was quenched, and I was left alone
in my misery, and it seemed, for a time, that nowhere
could I find the loved one for whom everything
and every one had been sacrificed; but better
for me was this misery than that fool’s paradise.</p>

<p>But I must return to my story, after this
digression, which, however, I hope many youthful
readers may peruse and take warning from. My
companion and I knelt, as I have mentioned; and
thus, upon our knees, we waited for the august
ceremony attending ever this mock marriage. All
heaven seemed to open, and all of earth seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to be passing away. I recollect that, after many
questions had been put to, and responses made by
us, and when sweet words, set to sweeter music,
had been sung, there reached our ears some such
words as these:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Bridegroom would have His bride leave father,
mother, houses, lands, and all earthly loves, in order that,
as the apostle saith, she may be one spirit with Him. My
daughter, canst thou do this?</p>

</div>

<p>To this we made reply severally:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In His strength I leave all, that I may follow Christ.</p>

</div>

<p>Then the reverend Father uttered these words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><em>Beware</em>, my daughter, before putting thy hand to the
golden plough, for <em>cursed</em> shalt thou be if perchance thou
lookest back.</p>

</div>

<p>To which the novice then replied:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I should then be unfit for the kingdom of God,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and repeated the words of Scripture:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When any one voweth a vow unto the Lord, he shall do
all that proceedeth out of his mouth (Num. xxx. 2);<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and again we quoted Ecclesiastes v. 4.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>After which there was sung in sweetest music,
three times over:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the
fat of rams: promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it.</p>

</div>

<p>I truly imagined that I was vowing to the
Lord; and I had heard that God was love, and
that therefore it must be sweet to obey His voice,
and so I willingly vowed unto the Lord in these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. I vow <em>holy poverty</em>, that I will possess nothing as my
own, or receive aught, save at the hands of my Superiors, or
with their permission. So help me, God. Amen.</p>

<p>2. I vow <em>holy chastity</em> during the time of my noviciate.
So help me, God. Amen.</p>

<p>3. I vow entire, unquestioning, and absolute obedience
to the Father and Mother Superior, during the term of my
noviciate. So help me, God. Amen.</p>

</div>

<p>My bridal veil was then removed, and my hair
cut off quite short; then I retired, and put on the
serge habit of a nun, and came back, and I had
placed upon me the scapular of obedience, the
cord of chastity, and the sandals of poverty. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
these, I again put on the nun’s veil and
bridal wreath. My companion and myself were
then given new names. I, Jane Mary Povey, was
called “Sister Mary Agnes of the Holy Child
Jesus”; Florence S⸺ was called “Sister Mary
Wereburgh of the Blessed Sacrament.”</p>

<p>The following hymn was then sung, which I
must give in full, as it affords such an insight
into the <em>delusion</em> of convent life. I believe Father
Ignatius is the writer of this hymn:</p>

<p>During the singing of this hymn the newly
made novice kneels, and all the sisters come, with
lighted tapers, to kiss and embrace their new
sister; after which a procession is formed, tapers
are carried, incense is burnt, and these words are
sung:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The wise virgins took oil in their lamps; they went in
with Him to the marriage, and the door was shut.</p>

</div>

<p>These words were scarcely finished, when a
door was suddenly and loudly slammed; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
seemed hard to realize that we were still in the
flesh, and there came to my heated imagination
some strange expectation of the beatific vision.</p>

<p>No wonder that brains are turned, and young
and inexperienced hearts are deluded and led
astray by such an imposing ceremony, which no
words of mine can adequately describe. You
must have been on the spot fully to realize it.</p>

<p>I would impress very strongly on all who read
these pages a fact that I think is not generally
known, viz., that there is in the convent no difference
whatever between a novice and a black-veiled
or fully professed nun with regard to vows
or rule, save that the latter vows for life, and the
novice for a time. Yet the novice believes that
she has no more right in the sight of God to go
back from her vows than a life-vowed nun has.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE VOW OF POVERTY.</i></span></h2>

<p>I purpose now to write a short chapter on
the Vow of Poverty. By this vow a nun has
stripped herself of everything; she no longer possesses
the right to use anything, or any member of
her body, without the permission of her superior.
Body and soul, hands, eyes, and feet, are all given
up; therefore the nun may not use her hands or
her feet even to perform a kind and helpful action
for her fellow-nuns, without first going to ask the
leave of her Superior. Often, especially at first,
I did not understand my obligation, and consequently
I would act without permission, and bring
upon myself the necessity of performing some
penance, that my sin might thus be atoned for.
A nun may be almost parched with thirst, yet she
must not drink even a cup of cold water without
first finding the Superior and asking her leave, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
even then she may not obtain it; and if leave is
granted, she may be censured for her alleged want
of mortification. The nun who has taken this
vow of poverty must never possess or make use of
anything which has not been either given or lent
to her by the Superior, neither can she borrow or
lend anything without leave. This kind of existence
really engendered the most abominable selfishness,
and I never saw any selfishness to equal
a nun’s. Her vow of poverty makes her selfish.
She has nothing but what is doled out scantily
by her Superior; and when she does get anything,
she takes good care to keep it, not knowing when
she will receive the like again. This does not
apply to anything great and valuable, but such
trifles as pins and needles, or cotton, or a piece of
paper, or a flower-pot. To give or lend a flower,
a picture, a thimble, a needle, a book, or anything
else, without leave, is to break the Vow of Poverty,
for which confession must be made, and reparation
by public penance.</p>

<p>Anything sent by the parents or relations of
the nuns may be disposed of as the Superior likes;
and should it be given to another nun, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
told, “Let the sister for whom that gift was sent
beware of murmuring at her Superior’s wisdom.”
Often did I have presents taken from me, without
form or ceremony, and given to another, my face
being carefully watched whilst the transfer was
being made, to see how I bore the trial, or if I
betrayed any signs of criticising the actions of
my Superior.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>I remember that once a dear little child was
brought into our community; and being very fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of children, and thinking of my brothers, I held
out my arms to the child, and was on the point of
kissing him, when I heard the authoritative voice
of the rev. Father, saying, “Sister Agnes, sit
down. Not without leave; you should ask first.”
I coloured as if accused of some great crime, and
sat down, but was too ashamed when recreation
time came to ask to kiss him then. I had only
been a novice for a few months, and did not think
of my vow of poverty being broken by using my
arms, or lips, or will, without leave.</p>

<p>Another time—it was at Christmas—I saved a
mince-pie to give away to the first poor person
who came to the door. I was portress then. An
old man came, and I related at recreation how
pleased he was with my gift; but, alas! I brought
down upon myself a little lecture, and was told
that I had no right to give convent property away.
“But,” said I, “it was mine—my very own.”
Whereupon I learnt that for me the words “mine”
and “thine” did not exist, since by this vow of
poverty everything belonged to the Father
Superior.</p>

<p>We might not even borrow a pocket-handkerchief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
though, as we were allowed but three, it was
often very necessary to borrow one, for we could
not without permission even wash them without
breaking rule. If a sister brought with her several
dozens, they would be distributed according to the
needs of the community, and the rest put away
for future use, as the new novice would be breaking
her vow by retaining more than she needed for
present use.</p>

<p>We were very fortunate in being allowed pocket-handkerchiefs
at all. I know another English
sisterhood where the nuns are only allowed hard
blue-checked dusters, and as the rev. Father and
Mother and sisters have the disgusting habit of
snuff-taking, they must find these dusters very
inconvenient.</p>

<p>Should we use any other article in lieu of a
pocket-handkerchief, it must be confessed, and
reparation made by holding such article up high
at the Magnificat, in the presence of the Blessed
Sacrament, so that all who were assembled might
see that we had robbed God of what we had
promised.</p>

<p>Again, if we broke any article, or put it to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
improper use, the penance consisted in placing the
said article, or piece of it, upon the head. Unfortunately
for me, I was famous for breaking
machine needles, and consequently I had to
balance them on the top of my head, which was no
easy matter.</p>

<p>Again, should we carelessly leave anything out
of its proper place, we had to wear that thing the
whole of the day. On two or three occasions I
have been adorned with a pail; I have had a brush
and dustpan round my waist, and a large coil of
clothes-line round my neck. I hope my readers
will now understand a little better what is implied
by the vow of poverty. This has been a short
chapter, but not, I think, an unimportant one.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE VOW OF CHASTITY.</i></span></h2>

<p>The Vow of Chastity is broken by allowing
any part of the arm to be seen above the
wrist, so that if we should be engaged in cleaning
furniture, or scrubbing floors, or washing clothes,
we are not allowed to turn up our sleeves; and as
the under garments are made of coarse serge with
long sleeves, which are only changed once a fortnight
throughout summer and winter, the discomfort
of this may easily be imagined. However,
the feet may be quite bare all the year round, for
those of us, at least, who were considered strong
enough, as it is quite in accordance with the Vow
of holy Poverty, to go without socks, stockings, or
sandals.</p>

<p>As I was very anxious to become a saint, I
gladly went about with bare feet for two winters,
until I had a bad cough, and was then not allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to do so any more. Often my feet were so swollen
and covered with blood that I could scarcely
move, but I was rather pleased at this, because the
saints endured like afflictions. By saints I mean
those men and women who have been canonized
by the Church of Rome. To this source we went
in order to find examples of how we might follow
Christ. Of course our lady, the “Mother of God,”
as the Church of Rome calls the mother of Jesus,
was always set before us as an example. Then
we were in the habit of placing our holy Father
St. Benedict before us; then to the various saints,
monks and nuns of our holy Order throughout the
world we went, and again to all the saints who had
been pronounced blessed by all the Popes who had
ever lived.</p>

<p>There is one saint, “blessed John Berchmans,”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
who is brought prominently forward in the “Diurnal
of the Soul,” who particularly irritated me, because
he was so perfect in every iota of his life. I used
to almost wish he had been occasionally careless,
or had now and again lost his temper. Whilst
reading “The Monks of the West,” I was quite
staggered by the wholesale self-butchery several of
these saints practised after their conversion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>I could never understand some of these saints.
St. Benedict, in order to overcome temptations to
break his Vow of Chastity, is said to have jumped
into a bed of thorns and briars. I thought I would
be before him, and prevent evil thoughts even
presenting themselves, so I obtained permission
to sting myself with stinging nettles twice a week,
and continued to do so for years, though it hurt
me dreadfully for two days after the operation.</p>

<p>A nun or novice breaks her Vow of Chastity by
allowing the dress of a secular lady to brush by
her sacred habit, or by raising her eyes to a lady’s
face when speaking to her, or by raising her eyes
at any time except during the one hour’s recreation.
Should her brother or father come to see
her, she must keep her face closely veiled from their
view. Very, very seldom is she sent to speak to
any other man, and then only if convent duty
makes it a necessity. It was quite impossible to
kiss or shake hands with any one, as we were only
allowed to see visitors through a small grille, the
holes of which were about an inch square, while a
professed nun was always near to hear what was
said. After a time the rule became stricter, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
grille was covered with a thick baize curtain, and
we received orders, in addition to keeping our large
thick veils down below the chin, not to draw the
curtain back to speak even to a woman. It was
also a great sin to speak to, or let any secular
women see our faces.</p>

<p>I remember at one time we had a charwoman to
work, and I was sent to sweep the kitchen, with
orders to keep the veil low down over my face.
In vain did I try to sweep, for I could not see, and
dared not raise my veil. At last the poor woman
tried to take the broom, saying, “Let me do it.”
I dared not allow this, for in so doing I should
have been guilty of the sin of disobedience, and
for the same reason I dared not speak. She
tried hard to get the broom, and I tried hard to
keep it, without speaking. At last I was almost
forced to open my mouth, and I said to her,
“Thank you, but I <em>must</em> do it.” So I finished the
work, and then in fear and trembling confessed
my fault to the reverend Father. He was very
angry, and made no excuse for my awkward
position, but told me not to attempt to justify my
conduct, and that there was no excuse for an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of disobedience. As a punishment, he sent me
then and there to recite the whole Psalter.</p>

<p>Should we grow to love a sister very much, we
are speedily forbidden to speak to, or hold any
communication with her. This of course does
not refer to our Superior, as she is in the place of
God to us.</p>

<p>Should we put our arm around a dear young
sister’s neck or waist, or even take hold of her
hand, such conduct would be a breach of this Vow
of Chastity, and we must confess that we have been
too demonstrative in our affections towards a
spiritual sister. In Butler’s “Lives of the Saints,”
we read that “St. Clare was so chaste that she
would not even touch her father’s hand.” It was
different with our Superior’s hand, as it was the
rule to kiss that hand when receiving the blessing.</p>

<p>In regard to confession, the same rules were
observed as have always existed in the Church of
Rome. Every thought, word, and deed had to be
confessed, and we had to answer any question the
priest might put to us, as nothing is wrong the
priest asks in confession; at least this is what
we were told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The priest I confessed to for the greater part of
my convent life made me clearly to understand
that all he said to me was for myself alone, and
was not to be repeated. He bid me keep nothing
back, and told me that if I did hide any known
sin I should be guilty of sacrilege, my confession
would be rendered invalid, and I should be putting
myself in the position of Ananias and Sapphira.
When I had finished my confession, he used to
ask several times, “Are you sure you have told me
everything?” It will thus be seen that there is
no loophole or excuse to keep anything back, and
I never did. Twice he asked me the most outrageous
questions, which made me almost shriek,
“No! Oh, no!”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I had been to him for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
years, and had laid my whole life open to him,
and there really could be no occasion for him to
put such questions to me on subjects that had
never before been presented to my mind, in any
shape or form. This priest is dead now, and I
seldom confessed to another. After I had been
a sister and under his direction for nine years, he
advised me to leave that convent. Why he gave
this advice, I do not know; but I replied at once
that I would never go back.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE VOW OF OBEDIENCE.</i></span></h2>

<p>The Vow of entire, unquestioning, and absolute
Obedience renders the Superiors tyrants and
their subjects slaves. A novice, or nun, must give
up her will, conscience, judgment, reason, and
her intellect, and must be merely a tool in her
Superior’s hands.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> She may not speak to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Superior without first prostrating her whole body
to the ground, kissing the hem of her “sacred
habit,” and then, leave to speak being given, she
may address her Superior, kneeling on both knees,
with the eyes fixed on the ground. She must
listen to her voice as the voice of God; for
has not God addressed each nun with some
such words as, “The Lord hath in His wisdom
set thy Superior, and her alone, over thee, and
He will only accept thy obedience through thy
Superior”?</p>

<p>Of course we soon learnt to look upon our
Superiors as possessing infallibility. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
words of the Lady Prioress of Llanthony convent:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What the Pope is to Roman Catholics, that a Superior is
to a nun. <em>I</em> cannot err, in regard to you; though I may do
wrong or make mistakes in regard to matters belonging to
myself, yet I cannot err as regards you, for our Lord would
not permit this. Therefore, no matter what I do or say to
you, it must be right, so far as it concerns you; it is God’s
will for you, and the very slightest rebellion against my wish
or orders, even in thought, is rebellion against God.</p>

</div>

<p>In “The Rule of our Most Holy Father St.
Benedict” (Burns &amp; Oates), on page 53, these
words occur: “The third degree of humility is
that a man, for the love of God, submit himself to
his Superior in all obedience, imitating the Lord, of
whom the apostle saith, ‘He was made obedient
unto death.’ … And in order to show that we
ought to be under a Superior, the word of God
says, ‘Thou hast placed men over our heads.’”</p>

<p>That this is a most extraordinary and utterly
unwarranted application (?) of Scripture, I need
scarcely point out to my intelligent readers.</p>

<p>Of course the Father Superior is as infallible
as the Mother Superior; and yet I have heard the
Llanthony Mother frequently criticise the reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Father’s doings when his actions did not exactly
fall in with her ideas, or if they at all clashed with
her will. This Mother, too, often accused me to
the reverend Father of things I had never done.
I recall to mind an occasion when I was smarting
under one of these unfounded accusations, and
how, in an agony of mind, I exclaimed, “It is not
true, and she knows it is not true.” The Father
Superior commanded me to be still, and listen
to God speaking to me. Practically we were
taught that the Lord only reveals His will to us
through our Superiors. A nun must obey the
convent bell as if it were the voice of an angel.
If she should be writing when the bell sounds,
she must instantly lay down her pen, without even
waiting to finish the formation of a letter; and
as an example of how pleasing such instant
obedience is to God, we were told that a certain
saint was called three times whilst reciting the
office of the Blessed Virgin; she obeyed promptly,
and on returning and taking up her book, she
found the letters written in gold;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and thus, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in this life, was her perfect obedience rewarded.
When the bell rings, or a Superior calls, everything
must be left at once, even though the nun knows
full well she will be penanced for leaving things
about, and yet she dares not stay to put them
away without a breach of this Vow of Obedience.</p>

<p>Once I was in the “Lady Chapel,” decorating
the shrine, and the bell rang before I had cleared
the faded flowers away. By <em>rule</em> I dared not
leave them, and by <em>rule</em> I dared not clear them
away, and of the two evils I chose to clear away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the faded flowers. Soon the Lady Prioress of
Llanthony came down, looked at me, and then
slammed the doors, which shut me out of the
nun’s choir. I was afterwards reproved by the
Superior, who said to me:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sister Agnes, if you go on in this way very much longer,
you will find yourself at last where you are now, outside the
doors of heaven, with the gate shut.”</p>

</div>

<p>The truth is, a nun’s obedience must be blind
in its character; there must be no waiting to
consider consequences, for by her vow she has
renounced all claim to herself, and should the
Superior command her to do what she believes
to be even wrong and sinful, it is her duty to
simply obey without a question, since the responsibility
rests rather upon the Superior who
gave the command than upon the nun who obeys
it. In obeying a Superior, a nun is more sure of
doing God’s will than if an angel came down from
heaven to give a command, seeing that Satan can
transform himself into an angel of light; but there
can be no possibility of mistaking the Superior’s
voice! (so we were taught).</p>

<p>Obedience to God being the only sure road to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
heaven, such obedience,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> for a nun at least, can
only be rendered pleasing and acceptable to God
through the channel of her Superior; so, without
strict obedience to the Superior, there can be no
hope of heaven. Thus a nun must act as one who
is not responsible to God for her actions! I pity
the Superiors, who have not only upon them the
weight of their own sins, but also that of all the
nuns under their care! They have yet to learn
that salvation is not the reward of man’s obedience,
but the free gift of God, by faith, without
works.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE DAWN OF SPIRITUAL LIGHT.</i></span></h2>

<p>I had been in the convent now for some eight
years, striving after perfection; but a wearisome
task it was, ever striving to observe all the
minutiæ of convent rules, ever confessing every
little deviation from the three vows aforementioned.
I had been taught that baptism had made
me a child of God; that original sin had, by virtue
of that rite, been taken away; but that, subsequently,
if I wished to retain God’s favour, I must
confess every sin of omission and commission, in
thought, word and deed; and that should I conceal
wilfully any matter, however trivial, my eternal salvation
would be endangered by any such concealment.
It is perhaps difficult for those who have
never been under such a hard yoke to imagine
the mental torture such a system creates. I was
often filled with fear lest I had not remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<em>everything</em>, and it is no easy matter to look back
through a whole life and lay everything bare before
God, in the presence of a man, whom we are
told to forget entirely, and think we are but
repeating everything to God, who knows all beforehand,
but who wills that we should come to
Him in this way; and whatever shame is felt in
thus opening our hearts and all its windings, must
be accepted willingly as a small suffering for our
sins. Sometimes a matter seems so silly or trivial
that one thinks it not necessary to confess it.
But the very fact of not wishing to confess it
proves it to be wrong, and therefore it must be
confessed. For years I went thus to confession,
conscientiously and scrupulously declaring the
whole of my inner and outer life. Thus did I
strive to find the peace I so longed for, and I
must say I did enjoy a certain satisfaction of mind
until I inadvertently broke some convent rule. A
sin of anger would be mortal; and had I died
without confession of this sin to a priest and
obtaining absolution, there would have been very
little, if any, hope of my soul’s salvation. I would
often confess, and weep tears of real pain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
bitter sorrow at my ingratitude to God, after His
wonderful condescension in calling me into the
“Religious Life,” while so many who possibly
would have grown far holier than myself were left
in the world, never even having the opportunity
of gaining so bright a crown, or of being so near
to Jesus hereafter. I would resolve and pray that
I might never do anything wrong against rule
(the rule is the nun’s guide to perfection, it being
the only way that God intends her to reach perfection)
or anything else; and to attain this perfect
state, I would often spend my recreation and sleep
time in making novenas to the blessed Virgin,
reciting the Rosary and Litany of the blessed
Virgin, or in invoking the saints; but they never
seemed to answer me, and even when I redoubled
my efforts, I sought their help in vain.</p>

<p>It was very difficult for me not to break rule
sometimes, and often it would be impossible to
perform obedience, as we had sometimes half a
dozen obediences to fulfil at the same time, or we
had some order given, and when it was accomplished,
we would be severely reproved for taking
upon us to dare to do such or such things; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
should we try and explain our conduct, by that
very explanation at least half a dozen rules were
broken straightway, namely, silence broken, self-justification,
answering the Superior, unwillingness
to take unjust rebuke with great gratitude, etc.,
for all of which we had hard penances imposed.
The result was that at times I was in a state of
continual penance, and consequently in prolonged
disgrace, whilst some sisters who were not so conscientious
in confessing faults, and doing penances
prescribed by rule, were deemed far holier and
much higher up the ladder than myself. At last
I thought myself so bad that I literally <em>despaired</em>
of ever reaching perfection, or of going to heaven
at all. But my Father Confessor did not think
me so bad, and, in fact, he flattered me, and
declared that he thought very highly of me; but
this only tended to alarm me, as I thought I must
be deceiving myself and him too, and I told him
this, but he assured me that I must not think so,
and that he felt sure I could not have such a bad
opinion of myself. However, for months and
months I was afraid to go to sleep lest I should
awake in hell; and I was equally afraid to get up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lest some accident should come upon me, and
then I should be cast into perdition. So I was
always asking to go to confession at every little
fault or breach of rule.</p>

<p>At last the climax came, when one day the
following passage from the writings of St. Alphonsus
Liguori was read aloud: “A soul may
yet be damned for sins which have already been
confessed.” How to keep silence I knew not, for
I felt how terribly I had been deceived in being
told that sin confessed is sin forgiven. The next
day I asked leave to go to my Father Confessor,
and when I was in his presence he asked me:</p>

<p>“Sister Agnes, have you come to confession?”</p>

<p>I replied, “No, I have not, for I don’t believe
in confession, or in anything, or anybody, or even
in myself, and I scarcely believe there is a God
at all.”</p>

<p>“Dear sister, what is the matter with you? I
have never seen you like this before. I always
thought you very good.”</p>

<p>Then I quoted the words of Liguori which had
so upset me, and added:</p>

<p>“You told me that everything I confessed was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
forgiven, and I believed you; but now I find it is
not true.”</p>

<p>He made at once the best explanation he could
of Liguori’s meaning, reconciling the words with
his own apparently contradictory statement: both
were right then. Be that as it may, I think that
from that day I lost faith in the value and efficacy
of confession, though I was obliged still to go
to it.</p>

<p>It was just at this phase of my experience that
I began to think about certain teaching that I had
heard vague and indistinct rumours of; namely,
that salvation was wholly the work <em>finished</em> for
sinners by the Saviour’s atoning blood. I had
fancied that there was no truth in this, and had
imagined it was some new doctrine introduced by
Methodists. Finding myself in such a dilemma,
I began to think a good deal about this doctrine,
and at last I heartily wished it was true. But I
had been so long taught that sacraments were the
only sure way to heaven, that I had much to do,
and after doing my utmost, I must look to Christ’s
work, so to speak, to supply my deficiencies, and
that only when I appeared in the presence of God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
after this mortal life could the great question of
my salvation be settled. I had so long been living
under the influence of such teaching that it may
be easily seen I was not very ready to accept any
other form of doctrine. Yet I could not get the
new idea out of my head. I somehow felt convinced
of the truth of it, but I was as yet too fast
bound in the old chains, and in this state of hovering
between two opinions I remained for some
time, until at length one night I made up my
mind I would not sleep till I had settled the question
between my own soul and God. The result
of this decision was that I determined to lay down
at the feet of Jesus all my sins, sorrows, and failings,
and even my best intentions, and just to trust
in His <em>finished</em> work. I thought I had actually
done this, and soon fell asleep; but on awaking
I felt greatly disappointed, and, kneeling down
before the crucifix in my cell, I confessed to
Christ how bitterly I had been disappointed in
finding that in trusting in His finished work, I
had not been able to find anything beyond a very
momentary peace. It was whilst thus kneeling
I felt—as truly I thought as it is represented in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“Pilgrim’s Progress”—the whole burden of everything
roll off, and a new life seemed then to thrill
through me.</p>

<p>I had now been, as I have already said, a nun
for about eight years, but my new experience did
not force me out of the old routine of convent life.
I quite well remember that Father Ignatius sometimes
taught a doctrine very closely allied to that
which I seemed lately so attracted by, but he
muddled it up with a lot of teaching that seemed
to contradict it. He certainly taught that all the
sacramental superstructure, saint-worship, confession,
etc., were only acceptable to God after we
had received Christ, and thus it was that I was
somehow led to believe that my new experience
was right, but yet that my old life need not be
set aside. I remember I was rather strengthened
to continue with new vigour my self-imposed religiousness.
Thus I continued, and it was only
after an experience of some seventeen years that
I saw that convent life—and any other life but
that of the faith of the Son of God, who loved me
and gave His life for me—was nothing else but
a delusion.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>LIFE AT FELTHAM CONVENT.</i></span></h2>

<p>Ten years were passed by me at Feltham.
Father Ignatius did not have very much to
do with us there. The Mother, I think, used to
let him know that she did not consider it a man’s
place to govern a number of women so entirely as
he wished to do. Besides, he sometimes gave orders
which she thought very indiscreet, from which
great scandal might arise; and, being somewhat
older than Father Ignatius, she took the liberty
of representing to him, rather strongly, her views
about his orders and doings. At times he would
suddenly give orders from the so-called “altar,”
where of course no one could well remonstrate,
and which would put the household arrangements
out for the whole day, though he seemed to be
in a great state of consternation when matters did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not go forward smoothly in consequence of his
orders. Sometimes, before breakfast, he would
order that no one, not even the reverend Mother,
should speak for a whole day, thus causing the
utmost confusion, especially amongst the servants
in the kitchen, who were included in the eccentric
command. And yet if his own dinner was not
properly cooked and served in time, he would
show great displeasure. Another time I recollect
how he ordered a young and delicate sister, who
was very ill and consumptive, to walk bare-footed
in the snow up and down the garden. On another
occasion he ordered her to carry a number of
stones till she had made a great heap, and then,
when she had done this, he ordered her to carry
them all back again! I remember also that once
he ordered a young monk, who had come to
Feltham with him, to put on a high hat, and then
to hop up and down the centre path in the convent
garden, so that all the nuns might see him.
He did this to test the young monk’s humility and
obedience, and to see if he was willing to become
a fool for Christ’s sake. The nuns did see this
extraordinary sight, and exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear Mother, do look at Brother ⸺. Is he
not a perfect fool?”</p>

<p>Nothing was too idiotic to impose in the name
of holy obedience. I have seen, for instance, a
brother, instead of kneeling to receive Holy Communion,
standing afar off, holding up a black
kettle, and at grace, in the refectory, with the
muddy street door mat on his head. I have seen
a sister with a handkerchief tied over her eyes, as
if she was just ready for a game of blind man’s
buff. Remember, these follies were ordered to be
done as penances, and penances were said to be
special gifts of love from the Lord Jesus Christ!
What profanity!</p>

<p>I am sure the reverend Mother had the greatest
trial in Father Ignatius’ freaks, or whatever
they may be called; and she soon began to get
sick of them, and would dread the ten days
he would sometimes spend at Feltham; for she
never knew what he was going to do or order
next. Once he intended to bring a young monk,
ill from his monastery, to be nursed by a young
novice nun, and she was to devote the whole
of her time to looking after him. This might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
have been well enough if we had been sisters
of charity; but we were enclosed nuns, and
were not allowed to see the face of a man,
except, of course, our Superior. The Mother
would not hear of such a thing, or allow the sick
monk to come to the house, as she was sure it
would prove an occasion of scandal. She thus
set up her will and judgment to oppose Father
Ignatius, and she did this on more than one
occasion. But at last Father Ignatius boldly
asserted that he was quite determined to have
nothing but <em>unconditional obedience</em>. The Mother,
and the majority of nuns in the Feltham convent,
refused to accept such an unconditional obedience,
and the result was that a split took place. The
Mother would not sign a paper of unconditional
and personal obedience, and so Father Ignatius
said to those who refused: “You no longer belong
to the order of the Monk Ignatius of Llanthony
in the nineteenth century.” However, he
took with him three nuns who were ready to
render the obedience he required. I was one of
the three. Another of the number was the nun
who took novice vows when I did. She had, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
meanwhile broken her vows, and had gone
into the world for some six years, and had been
a wife and mother. Her husband and child
having died, she had returned to Feltham a few
months before this split had taken place.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to contemplate how absolutely
Father Ignatius required us to yield our wills to
his will. Whatsoever he demanded was, he said,
distinctly God’s will for us, and whatsoever we
did for him was God’s will. To use his own oft-repeated
words:</p>

<p>“It must be so sweet for you to wait upon your
Superior, because in so doing you are really waiting
upon God; in fact, in waiting upon your
Superior, like Martha of old, you are waiting upon
the Lord Himself.”</p>

<p>I can assure my readers that we poor deluded
nuns believed in all this; and, so far as obedience
would permit, we literally vied with each other in
waiting upon our Superior and preparing for him
the very best we could, for we felt that nothing
could be too well prepared in waiting, as we
thought, upon the Lord. There was no greater
penance to us than to be debarred from waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
upon his will. If any one was in disgrace for
breaking rule, he would neither speak nor even
look at her, nor even allow her to kiss the hem
of his sacred dress!</p>

<p>After we had left Feltham a few weeks, Father
Ignatius, and the widowed nun who had accompanied
him, wrote several letters, in which the
rebel nuns of Feltham were exhorted to return
to their Father, by submitting to unconditional
obedience. He allowed them, I think, three
weeks to consider the matter; and if, at the close
of that time, they remained obstinate, he would, he
declared, excommunicate them, and then the awful
curse of broken vows would rest upon them. The
threatened curse was at length pronounced. The
altar was draped in black, and an excommunication
service was read through. I was greatly
terrified at this most strange yet solemn act. I
remember well the words that were uttered at
this service:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Unless they repent of this their sin, may they be blotted
out of the book of life. Amen, Amen.</p>

</div>

<p>Here the bell tolled. I was well nigh petrified
with fear, and thought to myself, “Can all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Feltham nuns really be under this awful curse?”
At the first opportunity I asked Father Ignatius
if the bell was really tolled for the Feltham Mother
and nuns? He said, “Certainly it was.” I exclaimed,
“How awful!” He replied, “True, my
child, but it had to be done.” I remember how
he often prophesied that the community at Feltham
would only flourish like a green bay-tree for
a time, and that ere long it would pass out of
existence; and I must honestly confess that he
did his very utmost to bring it to nought, by
efforts to draw away friends and support from it.
It has ever been a peculiarity of Father Ignatius
to curse and excommunicate people; but those
who are thus cursed only flourish all the more.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>CONVENT LIFE AT SLAPTON, IN
DEVONSHIRE.</i></span></h2>

<p>I will now pass on to say a few words about
my life at the Slapton convent, in Devonshire,
where we took up our abode after leaving Feltham.</p>

<p>We commenced life in our new home, which
was part of an old chantry house, with glad, bold,
and brave hearts, determined to keep the rules
which were imposed upon us. Our motto was
“In omnibus glorificetur Deus.” We were under
stricter rule than we had ever been before, but we
were glad of this, as we believed we were brought
nearer to Jesus the stricter the rule we kept.</p>

<p>I cannot say much for the peace and happiness
that fell to me here after two years had passed
away. During that period I was housekeeper—Mother
Wereburgh sacristan, and Mother Cecilia
scribe. I was greatly praised and flattered; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
there was one fault found with me, and this was
my unwillingness to obey implicitly the two sisters
who were put above me as my Superiors. The
fact is that both these nuns were jealous of me, on
account of the good opinion Father Ignatius had
of me. Besides, I am certain that Mother Cecilia
had no right to be made Novice-mistress, nor had
Mother Wereburgh right to be made Lady
Prioress. The former had not been properly
professed, and the latter was what is termed a
“desecrated virgin,” and it was unlawful, according
to the constitutions of St. Benedict, for either
of them to hold office. It was not right of Father
Ignatius to place these women over me in the
place of God, and to command me to see God in
them. Although I tried hard, I could not submit
to them, and thus my life became by no means a
smooth or happy one.</p>

<p>I may mention here that, whilst residing at
Slapton, a poor old woman was somehow induced
to sell her little home in Herefordshire, that she
might come to our convent; but alas! she “found
everything,” as she told me, “so different from what
I expected. My life is a misery to me. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
never believe in anything again.” I must say she
seemed at times somewhat peculiar; but when a
person of fifty years of age begins life over again,
and is expected to be as obedient as she was
required to be when quite a little child, is it to be
wondered at that such a return to an artificial
childhood causes bewilderment? It was nothing
else than devotion to Father Ignatius that caused
her to give up her home.</p>

<p>It was the rule in choir to <em>hold</em> books; when
sitting, to have the palm of each hand resting on
each knee; and when kneeling, to do so perfectly
upright, with hands crossed on each breast. Now
this old woman had not taken any vow of obedience,
and she either forgot to keep her hands
in a proper position, or did not choose to do
so; consequently the reverend Father, during the
service, would cross the choir to her seat, and
put her hands in the proper position. Five
minutes afterwards she would have them clasped
or folded, whereon the Father had to come to
her again repeatedly. At last the poor old thing
would cry and become quite hysterical. Mother
Wereburgh told her she had better go home, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
she had none to go to, for she had parted from
her own home, believing that she was coming
to one. Once she ran away and scandalized
the nuns to the villagers. When she came back,
the Mother sent for the village policeman, as
she made out that the poor old woman was
violent; and with the help of the policeman, she
was conveyed away in the carrier’s cart, and she
gave the constable the money to pay her fare to
her own home again.</p>

<p>The unkindness of the two sisters was quite
sufficient to make the old woman strange and
angry. I remember how she denounced these
nuns, assuring them that the Lord would take
vengeance on them, and it was such a speech that
caused the Mother Superior to draw the policeman’s
attention to the alleged fact that she was mad. The
simple-minded man said he could “see it.” Now
this policeman was made favourably disposed to
the nuns, when we first went to Slapton, by the
present of a leg of mutton going to his family for
a Sunday dinner, and other gifts of a similar kind.
The old woman was really no more mad than I
am at present, but she was often made frantic with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
anger by the conduct of the Mother. After her
return home she wrote for some clothes she had
left behind at the convent, and asked the Mother
to return everything that belonged to her, upon
which the Mother assured Father Ignatius that she
had taken all her belongings with her. Soon after
this I happened to be at the linen-press with the
Mother, and there I saw some of the old woman’s
clothes, and exclaimed, “See, here are the things
she asked for!” The Mother replied, “Oh, they
are only old rags.” They were not. “But,” said
I, “are they not what she wrote for?” Three
times afterwards she wrote for them, for she was
badly off, having sold all her little earthly possessions
to enter the “holy, happy cloister.” Father
Ignatius again asked the Mother to send the things
off; yet in my presence she said: “I assure you,
dear Father, there is nothing here of hers, and to
make certain of this, I looked all through the linen
cupboard the other day, and could not find a
single garment belonging to her.” I dared not
open my lips, or even say a word to help this poor
old woman to regain her clothes. They were of
no value to the Mother; but once having denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that they were there, she would not acknowledge
she had made a mistake, and would stick
to it.</p>

<p>I remember too how, whilst at Slapton, an
ignorant girl came to be what is called a lay-sister.
She knew nothing of any kind of religion whatever,
yet in a few months she made her first communion,
and took novice vows for one year. I am
sure she had no more idea than a new-born babe
of what she had undertaken, or what was expected
of her; and the hundred and one rules we had to
conform to in each day were frightfully bewildering.
This poor creature consequently was frequently
breaking rule, and was therefore plunged in penance,
disgrace and misery, and really for no fault
of hers. After about two months she was sent
back to the world, as she was always in trouble,
especially as she was very fond of talking to the
gardener, and could not see the sin of an enclosed
novice talking to a man, or why she should cover
her face with her veil when she wanted to see him,
or any one else. As she could not make head or
tail of the “glorious holy life,” and was thoroughly
miserable in it, she was dispensed from her vows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and sent away in a kind spirit, which was from a
<em>prudent</em> motive.</p>

<p>I will mention the case of another young lady
who came to our convent as a postulant. When
she had been there a few days, she felt she had
done wrong in leaving her only brother, as she
had so much influence over him for good, and
they were orphans. With the Mother’s permission,
she went back. The reverend Father was absent
at the time. On his return, he sent off a letter
to her, telling her that the curse of God would
be upon her—that she had no faith in God. She
should leave her brother in His hands, and he
actually told her that she was a spiritual adulteress.</p>

<p>It is important that my readers should
thoroughly grasp this fearful moral compulsion,
which is exercised on impressible and easily influenced
minds. And yet the world is told that
postulants, and novices, and professed nuns, are
quite free to go back if they choose. The letter
of Ignatius brought this young lady back, and she
was duly put to penance for leaving. She had
to cover her face with a black mask, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
divine office, which is recited seven times a day
and once at night. She had to sit upon the
ground during the time allowed to sitting in those
offices, and she was ordered to sit on the floor to
eat her food. After meekly going through all her
penances for the space of six weeks, she took
novice vows, when her beautiful long hair was cut
off quite short, in token of her renunciation of the
world. She was a sweet girl of about nineteen at
the time, and I know full well that she was as
thoroughly miserable as she could be. When she
had been a novice some time, the Lady Prioress
announced to her publicly:</p>

<p>“Sister Ermenild, you have been a novice now
over two years. Reverend Father and I both
think it time you made your profession; so please
to get ready to take the black veil.”</p>

<p>Although this profession was made after we had
removed to Wales, I may as well give a short account
of it in this chapter.</p>

<p>A solemn service was performed, in which the
nun was “married to Jesus Christ, Son of the
most high God.” A ring was placed on her finger
as a token and pledge thereof, after which she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
laid out on a mattress, over which was placed a
black pall, ornamented with a white cross. The
Burial Service from the Book of Common Prayer
was then read over her, earth being solemnly
dropped upon her. The <cite>De Profundis</cite> was sung
for the repose of her soul, after which the altar was
then divested of its black funeral hangings (which
had been put on for this part of the service),
and soon afterwards Sister Ermenild appeared
in her bridal attire. She was a new creature now,
raised, so to speak, to a new life. She was then
led to the altar, bearing in her hands a massive
lighted taper, and wearing a virgin’s crown, during
which proceeding a hymn was sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Dead with me, then death is over,</div>
<div class="verse">Dead and gone are death’s dark fears.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After which came “<em>the cursing</em>,” a ceremony
which is always used in the Roman Catholic
Church in the consecration of a virgin, and is to
the effect that—</p>

<p>“Should any one attempt to draw aside this present
virgin, let him be cursed in his rising up and
sitting down, in his standing or walking, in sleeping
or waking, in eating or drinking, etc., etc., and may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
his flesh rot from his bones, and may he be blotted
out of the book of life. Amen, amen, so be it.”</p>

<p>After all this cursing was finished, the now
reverend Dame Mary E. was enthroned on a seat
covered with rich crimson plush, which was placed
upon the altar steps, that from thence she might
give all who went up to her the blessing. Father
Ignatius led the way, followed by monks, boys,
nuns, girls, and as many seculars as felt inclined
to go. The service was then finished.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>In less than a month after, being in great
trouble and disgrace with her Superior (for what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it would be a puzzle to find out), Sister E. said
to me:</p>

<p>“Oh! how I wish I had never taken the black
veil!”</p>

<p>“But,” said I, “you wanted to?”</p>

<p>She said, “No, I never asked to. You yourself
heard what the reverend Mother said to me; and
previous to that, she had not uttered a word on
the subject.”</p>

<p>“But,” said I, “you know what the reverend
Father said before every one, how eloquently he told
them that the virgin about to be professed was not
yet bound, and even at that last minute she was
perfectly free to return to the world if she chose;
but that only after she had taken this awful step
she could not go back?”</p>

<p>To which she replied: “Yes, he did, I know,
say so in public, but you do not know what he
said to me in private.”</p>

<p>Oh, how easily the world is deceived by such
high-sounding phrases! “The doors are open—all
are free to leave as soon as they like, etc.”
When people speak of inspecting convents, they
should remember that to do so thoroughly, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
beyond what is visible to the eye must be
investigated, even the interior of each nun’s heart,
and the terrible moral force that has been brought
to bear upon it. And remember, too, that if a
sister’s own mother or sister came to see her, she
could not discover the deep distress that so often
lies upon her daughter’s heart. No nun would
<em>dare</em> to tell it, even to her mother, though her heart
might be breaking with misery. She would have
to appear before her mother with the look of one
who is perfectly happy, and even smiling, otherwise
she would be instrumental in bringing disgrace
and scandal upon the convent, and this, at all
cost, must be avoided. I have had to appear thus,
looking happy and free before my own mother,
when a few minutes before I had been crying,
wishing and praying that I might die.</p>

<p>After this digression, I will return to give an
account of a novice at Slapton, who took vows
on the same day as Sister E. just mentioned.
They promised to let her take the black veil soon,
provided only that she showed herself a submissive
child (this child was over thirty), who had no
wish or opinion but that of her superiors. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
unfortunately for her, she had a very natural habit
of forming an opinion for herself, and admitted
that she thought it no harm to do so, as long
as she kept that opinion to herself. But there
was great harm in this (so the Superior said),
inasmuch as a novice should be in all things of
one mind with her Superiors, in thought, word,
and deed. This novice brought with her a
valuable gold watch, which she was content to
give up for the time being, and, according to
novice rules, she had given up her box and keys.
The Mother had looked into Sister F.’s box, and
there saw some things she wanted for use in the
convent, and she told Sister F. so. The novice,
however, was not willing that they should be
used, as she had not taken life vows; in this
way she first drew upon herself the Mother
Superior’s displeasure and censure. Shortly after
this she was asked to give up her money to help
in building a new cloister at Llanthony. She said
she was willing to give up a part but not the whole,
and would very much like to put a stone in the
building. Thus by exercising her own opinion she
was again brought into disgrace, and was told she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
could keep her money, and would not be allowed
the privilege of putting a stone to the building.
She must give up all her money or none. From
that time she was treated with the greatest
severity, and looked upon as the offscouring of all
things. To make a long story short, she was soon
packed off from Slapton as having no vocation
to the “religious life.” How strange it was that
her Superiors were unable to detect this until they
discovered that she was unwilling to give up her
money to build a holy cloister! Before this they
had a very good opinion of her.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>CONVENT LIFE AT LLANTHONY.</i></span></h2>

<p>I was looking forward to taking the black veil,
but somehow the Mother had made a firm resolve
to keep me, if possible, from taking this step.
I may be permitted to write a few words about
the present Lady Prioress of Llanthony. This lady
took novice vows with me in 1869. She gained
a great reputation for sanctity by an assumed air
of humility, and by performing innumerable
voluntary penances and antics, which put her less
saintly sisters to much discomfort and disgust.
I recollect her once sitting next to me in the
refectory at dinner, when I saw a roasted maggot
on her plate, which made me feel quite ill. I
signed to her, fearing she would eat it unperceived,
whereupon she at once took it upon her fork, salted
it, and put it into her mouth, looking the very
picture of goodness. She would of her own free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
will throw herself down on the floor, and meekly
kiss everybody’s feet, beg their prayers, and thank
them for bearing with her, saying she was not
worthy to be amongst us, etc. This continued
until we were all perfectly sick of her, as we
knew quite well by her other words and actions
that she considered herself the best in the house.
Sometimes she would bang her head purposely
against the wall; in fact, she copied every
saint, whose life she happened to be reading at
the time, in his or her foolish actions, whilst if
they did anything sensible, she left it out. St.
Mary Magdalene of Piazzi, was her special
favourite. Sister Wereburgh once planted a
rotten cucumber, to see if our Lord would make
it grow into a plant, which, of course, He did
not, though she quite thought He would. This
was in imitation of a St. Teresa, who, we read,
once gave a rotten cucumber to one of her novices
in order to test her obedience, desiring her to
plant it in the garden. The novice obeyed without
a question, when, in reward for her perfect
obedience, a plant sprang from it, and bore fruit.
This is one of the miracles recorded in the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of Saint Teresa. Sister Wereburgh would obtain
leave to go without her dinner, and fast till tea-time,
very often, but was desired to have some
lunch, which would consist of dry bread. The
Mother Superior at that time never asked her
what lunch she had, but at last some of us found
out that she had a good helping of bread and
butter, and a good-sized cup of hot cocoa. She
was housekeeper then, and thus had no difficulty
in taking what she wanted. Thus she really had
more than we did at dinner, which often consisted
of two small sardines, three or four small potatoes,
and half a slice of bread, thinly cut, and some
water. As I do not wish to appear in the least
vindictive, I will not now add more about this sister.
She was the cause of distress to more persons
than myself, though she managed to keep herself
in favour with Father Ignatius, and became quite
his model nun.</p>

<p>I will now tell my readers more of my experiences
at Llanthony. I cannot say Father Ignatius
gave us a very warm welcome to our new convent.
In the first place, I remember well how
dreadfully he frightened me by telling us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the place was haunted by evil spirits, as well as
good. We were told by Ignatius that he had
watched a whole procession of devils cross the
church, while they were at matins. The brothers,
we were assured, had often seen them about the
house. One brother at the monastery declared
that he had felt their hot breath on his cheek.
This brother was a life-vowed monk, though only
about twenty-one years of age. He ran away
and came back so many times, that at last he
said, “To prevent myself from ever returning,
I shall get married,” which he fulfilled by marrying
an opera girl. I was told that afterwards he
became a billiard-marker.</p>

<p>The Novice-mistress came into our room one
day, saying:</p>

<p>“I have seen him.”</p>

<p>“Seen whom?” we asked.</p>

<p>“The devil,” she replied.</p>

<p>I was really frightened by the tales of the
devils who inhabited the cloister; and to add to
my terror, Father Ignatius and the Novice-mistress
told me:</p>

<p>“Sister Agnes is SURE to see him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>I used to go about night and day, making the
sign of the cross, praying to our Lord, the blessed
Virgin, and to our holy Father St. Benedict, not
to let me see anything, either good or evil. Sometimes
I did not hear the call for the night office,
and would only awake at the sound of the bell.
This necessitated my going down a long dark
passage alone, and returning alone to and from
the church; besides, I had to stay in the church
alone after matins and lauds, to recite the whole
of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, as a penance
for not rising when called. Not hearing was no
excuse; and if we only remained in bed thirty
seconds after being called, and attempted to leave
the church with the others, the Novice-mistress
would make signs for the sister who failed to rise,
to stop and perform her penance. It used to take
me a long time to do my penance, as I kept
leaving off to watch for a devil.</p>

<p>There is supposed to be a miraculous light over
the “altar,” which was pointed out to us on the
first day of our arrival at Llanthony. I looked
for a long time, but failed to see anything but
the sunshine. At last the reverend Father said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you see it, Sister Agnes?”</p>

<p>I replied, “No, dear Father, I do not see anything
but cobwebs and sunshine.”</p>

<p>I must not omit to write on a very distressing
subject, and that is the ill-treatment I received
from the Lady Prioress. After I had been about
a week at Llanthony, she sent for me. On coming
into her presence I knelt at her feet, and she gave
me the hem of her dress to kiss. It should be
remembered that we were not usually allowed to
speak to the Superior without first prostrating our
faces to the ground, and kissing the hem of her
“holy habit.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But I had better give the very
words of the rule: “To receive the words of our
Superior, humbly kneeling, with eyes fixed on the
ground.” Should we break this rule, the order
was “to receive any penance our Superior liked
to inflict.” My Superior on this occasion said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
“Sister Agnes, you often say you wish to submit
to me.” I replied, “Yes, dear Mother.” On
which she said, “Hold your tongue, and listen to
me, for now I am going to prove you; and the first
thing, before I say any more, I must ask you to
take off your <em>scapular</em>, for you are not fit to wear
it.” You, my readers, must please understand that
to give up the scapular was a terrible disgrace, and
it quite cut any sister off from many privileges
which are highly prized, such as communion and
recreation. She now imposed a severe penance
upon me. I had to become <em>a door-mat</em>; that is, I
had to lie prostrate in front of the church door, so
that nuns, girls, monks, and boys should walk over
me, and I was not allowed to get up until the last
one had entered the church. I did not mind the
nuns and girls treading upon me, but my nature
did recoil from lying down for men to walk over
me. They themselves hesitated a moment, and
then deliberately walked over me. They were
under obedience, and had they refused, would have
incurred punishment. This penance was to last
seven times a day for a week. The next penance
she imposed was to make me lie prostrate on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
face in front of my stall for a week during the
night office, which lasts from 2 a.m. to 3.45 a.m.
Then a third penance I had to undergo was to be
deprived of my breakfast, and thus to go without
food till 12.30 p.m.; and when I was permitted to
eat, I remember I had to take my plate and kneel
before each sister, and beg food from each in turn.
Though they afforded me a generous supply, I was
often too ill to partake of it. After enduring two
days’ fasting in this fashion, the Novice-mistress
begged that I might have a cup of tea, and a piece
of bread at 9 a.m. She told me I must eat this,
or I should become seriously ill. Ah! I did feel
ill, quite wretched! but yet I longed to be quite
good, pure, and holy, and this made me submit
so willingly to these dreadful penances. Often at
this and subsequent periods my life was such a
burden to me, that I have begged and prayed
that God would let me die. “O God, if you
would only grant me death!” has been my prayer
over and over again.</p>

<p>At that time I had not allowed myself to think
of giving up convent life. Such a thought to me
then would have been sacrilege, and the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
greatest unfaithfulness to the Lord, to whom I
believed myself espoused. These words which
had been repeated in my ears, sounded loudly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Knowest thou not that the novitiate is a solemn espousal
to our Lord Jesus Christ, and the consummation of the
bridal tie with thy Lord will be expected of thee when thou
shalt take the final vows?”</p>

</div>

<p>I could not forget that when I had been asked
at the service of taking novice vows.</p>

<p>“What will become of you if you ever turn back,
after taking up the golden plough?”</p>

<p>I had to make this reply: “I should then be
unfit for the kingdom of God.”</p>

<p>Awful words were these, words which seemed
like the announcement of our own eternal damnation.
Father Ignatius now says, “Why did
you do these penances? You were at liberty to
refuse, and leave the convent.” But I would ask
my readers to try and understand what <em>that</em>
implied, what terrible <em>mental torture</em> (a form of
torture more cruel and bitter than that imposed
of old by the Inquisition) such a step involved.
I am afraid no one <em>can</em> realize it who has not
herself passed through it. It is a maddening kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of torture, because one is strained up to such a
pitch, and made to think of the awful sin against
God and one’s own soul by going back; when for
all eternity, by a little submission here, one would
hereafter become the spotless bride of the Lamb,
and gain a glorious crown to lay at His feet.</p>

<p>I am sure that never did any girl enter a convent,
and remain in it for so many years, with a
more sincere intention of serving and pleasing
God through the will of her Superior than I did.
I had been told many times that—</p>

<p>“God in His wisdom has appointed the reverend
Mother, and declares that He will only
accept your obedience through her, and through
her alone.”</p>

<p>And yet she was the very one that made obedience
impossible, by giving me rules that were
beyond my power to fulfil; and often orders were
given me, which I fulfilled, and yet would after
all be reprimanded severely for daring to take
upon myself to do them.</p>

<p>After suffering much at her hands for three
years, I became convinced that she would never
treat me better, and I made up my mind to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the convent. When I asked her permission to
leave, she always replied, “Yes, you can go. You
may go at this moment if you like.” Yet she
never did anything to further my departure.
How could I go without clothes to put on? and
I had nothing but my serge habit and cap, and
was without money for my fare. Besides, it was
many miles through a wild country to the nearest
railway station, and I was ignorant of the way,
and had been shut away from the world for sixteen
years, from the early age of fifteen. The
only journeys I had made were from convent to
convent, and even then we had thick veils over our
faces all the way, and were told not to put them
up, though we were in close carriages. I wrote
several times to my sister, asking her to send me
some money to pay for my journey, and to tell me
how to get to her, and to meet me. Over and over
again I wrote to her, and received no reply. At
last I discovered that my letters were not sent. Yet
the world is told that nuns have <em>free</em> intercourse
with their friends outside. <em>Nothing of the kind!</em></p>

<p>At last I wrote another letter, and forced myself
into my Superior’s presence (for she had now forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
me to go near her), and asked her to allow
the letter to go by this post. I told her that
it was to my sister, and that I had written for
journey money, as I intended to leave. At this
she quite raved, saying:</p>

<p>“Go out of my room this instant! I shall not
allow your letter to go to your sister. You write
so badly that it is a disgrace to the convent;
and your other sister has written asking me not
to let you write to her, as your letters worry
her so.”</p>

<p>This was not true, as my sister has since told
me that she wrote to the Superior requesting her
kindly to give me a few details about my mother’s
death. I had often written to my sister asking
for a piece of my mother’s hair, and it worried her
so, as my darling mother was burnt to death, and
there was nothing left of her but a charred coal.
I had been told only that she was dead, and, very
naturally, I wanted to know all about it, and continually
asked for the circumstances of her death,
and a piece of her hair.</p>

<p>The reverend Mother knew all about it, my sister
having written it in the first letter announcing my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
mother’s death, and yet she never told me what
had taken place. My sister had now again written
to the Superior asking her to tell me all about
it, so that I should not be always asking the
same question, which so worried my sister to
have repeated unnecessarily as she thought.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> My
brothers, I learnt afterwards, had sent me their
photographs, but they had been returned, after
which they never wrote to me again, and I had
meanwhile been wondering why I never heard
from them.</p>

<p>I now felt utterly desolate to think I could not
write to my sister, and I was in terror what would
happen to me next: somehow I did not like to
run away, as it then seemed to me dishonourable,
so I said to a young sister, who I knew would
report it:</p>

<p>“You know, I have asked over and over again
to be allowed to go, and the reverend Mother will
not let me. Now I am determined to watch my
opportunity and run away; I shall stop at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
first house I come to, and send some one up here
to ask for money to pay my fare.”</p>

<p>An hour after this, the Novice-mistress came
with a sun-bonnet, a black and white shawl, and
a sovereign, saying:</p>

<p>“The reverend Mother says you have asked to
go so many times. Now George is going to the
station, and can drive you down there to-morrow.
These are all the clothes she has to give you, and
that money” (putting the sovereign down on the
table) “<em>belongs to the altar</em>. If you choose to do
so, take it, and you are to take <em>nothing</em> away with
you, not even a change of clothes.”</p>

<p>To this I replied: “Tell the reverend Mother I
cannot go out a beggar; all I want is a change of
clothes.”</p>

<p>She sent an answer back by a new sister.</p>

<p>“You came to her a beggar, and you will go
away a beggar.”</p>

<p>It may be asked how it was that I felt so
determined to leave. Before going on to relate
how at last I did leave, I will mention that which
<em>provoked</em> me to my determination. I am sure that
my readers will not think it a trifling provocation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
It was as follows. One day the Mother Superior
summoned us all to chapter, and commenced
speaking to us thus:</p>

<p>“My dear children, I have come to the conclusion,
which has now for some time been growing
upon me (but I am now convinced of it), that poor
Sister Agnes is <em>mad</em>.”</p>

<p>Every one seemed to start at this absurdity. I
could only smile. She went on to say:</p>

<p>“Yes, I am quite convinced of it! and, poor
child, this madness will grow upon her unless you
are all very kind to her, and you all know how
mad people are treated. You must never contradict
them, and, therefore, you must never contradict
Sister Agnes. If you do, the madness will
increase; you must just say ‘yes’ to everything,
unless you know she wants you to say ‘no’; you
need not take the trouble to talk to her, or put
yourselves out for her, unless she asks you a question;
then simply smile at her and say ‘yes.’”</p>

<p>She then turned to me and said:</p>

<p>“I forbid you to go into church at all, or to
speak to any one, unless it is absolutely necessary;
but of course you will do as you like about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>My first thought was, “What a blessing! for I
shall get a little peace now!” I was in peace for
two days, and, if I asked questions about my work
or anything, the sisters all smiled graciously, and
nodded their heads, or replied, “yes.” After two
days had passed, I began to wonder whether I
really was mad or not. This thought took such
hold upon me that I would sit for hours with my
head in my hands, wondering if I had really lost my
reason. The thought drove sleep from me, and, in
fact, was slowly driving me really mad. I asked
that new sister (L⸺ W⸺, from Devonshire) if
she thought I was mad. She told me she did <em>not</em>
think me so; but I supposed that perhaps she
only said this to please and humour me, according
to the instructions given by the Mother Superior.
She assured me, however, that she really knew I
was not mad. In spite of this assurance, my mind
was in as much doubt as before, and I arrived at
the conclusion that if I was not already mad, I
soon should be, with this awful doubt on my
mind.</p>

<p>I again asked leave to go, and the reverend
Mother replied before them all:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have nowhere to send you; directly I have,
you shall go.”</p>

<p>“But,” I replied, “I want to go to <em>my sister</em>.”</p>

<p>Turning to the chapter again, she said:</p>

<p>“I assure you I only keep her here out of love.
She is a poor child, without a friend in the world,
entirely dependent on my charity, and that of the
reverend Father.”</p>

<p>A strange suspicion was now borne into my
mind, from what the Mother Superior had said
about sending me away when she had a place to
send me, that she was actually trying to drive me
mad, and would then send me to a lunatic asylum.
Hence arose my final decision to leave the convent
at any cost.</p>

<p>To show my readers the kind of treatment I
received from this lady, I will mention that one
evening I was sitting alone, when suddenly I felt
a great pain go through my head—so great that it
almost stupified me. Then I felt a sudden box on
my left ear, another on my right. I cried out,
“Oh! oh!” not quite making out what it was, for
the first blow had nearly stunned me.</p>

<p>Then a voice sounded, “I don’t care if I kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
you,” and I saw close to me the Lady Prioress,
or the reverend Mother Mary Wereburgh of the
Blessed Sacrament!</p>

<p>O God, Thou knowest what I write is true,
without adding to it or taking aught from it; and
yet I had been induced to leave my own precious
mother, and had been told that the love of a
<em>spiritual</em> father and mother and sister was so great,
that the love of one’s own parents and sisters was
not to be compared to it. I always craved to be
loved. I had left all my earthly relations only to
gain what I was told was a higher, purer, holier,
and more noble love.</p>

<p>Behold my reward! And such shall be yours,
my reader, if you should unhappily follow in my
footsteps. Yes, disappointment will follow you,
bitterness of heart beyond all description, a longing
to go back to those dear ones whom you have
left, and yet not daring to go lest the curse of God
should fall upon you. I have spent seventeen
years in the cloister, and let me tell you that
nearly all, or, at least, a full half of that period
was one of bitter sorrow and disappointment.</p>

<p>It was quite a common thing to have our ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
boxed by the Lady Superior. In consequence, I
became quite deaf in one ear, and, consequently,
was often unable to hear the orders given me.
I was reported to the reverend Father for disobedience,
and I told him that it was through no
fault of mine that I had failed in obeying orders,
but that I had had my ears boxed to such an
extent that I had become quite deaf in one ear.</p>

<p>One day I was coming from nones at 2.45 p.m.
This “Mother” commanded me to stay where I
was, and not to return to work, and then said:</p>

<p>“You have got the DEVIL in you, and I am
going to beat him out.”</p>

<p>All left the sacristy but myself, the Mother
Superior, and one nun, who was ordered to be
present at the casting out of the devil. I was
commanded first to strip. I saw “the Discipline,”
with its seven lashes of knotted whipcord in her
hand, and I knew that one lash given (or taken
by oneself) was in reality seven. I should mention
that at certain times it was the rule to discipline
oneself.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Now my first thought when commanded to strip
was, “I can’t;” it would not be right or modest
to strip (it meant to the waist). Then it came
into my mind that Jesus did not thus think, when
the soldiers ordered Him to strip to be scourged.
He simply obeyed, and I felt sure that what He
did I might imitate. So I said inwardly, “Yes,
dear Lord, for love of Thee I can.” Then I began
to undress; but when I came to my vest, shame
again overcame me.</p>

<p>“Take that thing off,” said the Mother Superior.
I replied, “I cannot, reverend Mother; it’s
too tight.” The nun who was present was told
to help me to get it off. A deep feeling of
shame came over me at being half nude!</p>

<p>The Mother then ordered the nun to say the
“<cite>Miserere</cite>,” and while it was recited she lashed me
several times with all her strength. I was determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
not to utter a sound, but at last I could
not restrain a smothered groan, whereat she gave
me one last and cruel lash, and then ceased.</p>

<p>Even three weeks after she had “Disciplined”
me, I had a very sore back, and it hurt me greatly
to lie on it (our beds were straw put into sacks).</p>

<p>There was a looking-glass in the room I now
occupied (nuns do not usually have them), and
I looked to see if my back was marked, as it was
so sore. Never shall I forget the shock it gave
me. I turned quickly away, for my back was
black, blue, and green all over.</p>

<p>I will explain to my readers what “devil” in me
it was that the Lady Prioress had been attempting
to drive out. You have seen how very
unkind she had been to me, and, not daring to
speak to her, I made a cake, which I knew her
to be very fond of, and sent a note with it,
begging her to be kind to me; and I told her I
was willing to do anything if only she would
be kind. I asked what she would have done if
kindness had not been shown to her, when she
asked for readmission to the Feltham convent;
and I implored her, by the remembrance of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
kindness which had been shown her, to be kind
to me, and I signed myself, “Your loving child,
M. A.,” or words as near to this as I can now
remember. This was the “devil” I had at this and
at all other times. The fact is, that I knew too
much about her, which no other sister did, and
yet I never even breathed it to a soul!</p>

<p>Owing to the hard life we had to lead at the
convent, I was not at all strong; in fact, I frequently
felt ill and tired. I was often so weary
that I could have laid down and willingly died.
I often found it difficult to walk downstairs and
up again in the middle of the night. The novice-mistress
would then sometimes roughly push me,
to make me go faster. I would often faint whilst
reciting the Psalms aloud, and drop down on the
floor, thus always hurting my head. If Father
Ignatius happened to be near, they would show
me some degree of kindness; but if he was away,
they would drag me out of chapel and try to
make me walk upstairs, or I was roughly pushed
or dragged up when I had not the strength to
walk. Once I remember they put me out into
the sacristy, and laid me on the step of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
folding door which led to the garden, and, opening
the door wide, they left me there whilst they
went back to prayers. I had fainted, and on
recovering I would have given anything for
some water, but not a drop did they give me.
After a while I got so cold, and could not move
myself, but, notwithstanding my pitiable condition,
I had to wait till they came out of chapel.
I was only partly dressed, and it was in the
depth of winter. The next day I could not
speak, and had a severe attack of bronchitis.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It certainly was no temptation to faint, and
they must have known I was not shamming,
because Father Ignatius, who was always very
kind in any illness, once brought Dr. Hanson to
see me whilst in a faint, who said, “It comes from
weakness. This young nun is very weak.”</p>

<p>Once the Mother Superior actually pinned a
large paper in front of me, and another on my
back. On the latter was written in large letters:
“Jesus”—“Mercy”—“Pray for me”—“Beware
of me.” All through that day I had to wear this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and saw the partly hidden smiles, and heard the
loud laugh of those about me. I did not criticize
or make any objection, and tried to bear with
equanimity this humiliation.</p>

<p>At another time she wrote a confession for me
to copy, sign, and send to Father Ignatius. In
this confession were these words: “I felt great
repugnance to obey, when reverend Mother desired
me to give up all the letters and books
which reverend Father had given me.” This was
untrue, but holy obedience compelled me to write
the untruth, and I copied the confession out, and
sent it over to the monastery. In a few hours
the reverend Father came over, called a chapter,
and quoted what I had written as a proof that
I would not submit to the reverend Mother.</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “dear Father, I did not feel a
repugnance, or let myself think anything; I obeyed
at once.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you write this note to me?”</p>

<p>I replied, “The reverend Mother told me to
write it.”</p>

<p>“Did you, dear Mother?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No!” was her answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>I then said, “Well, she did not exactly tell me.
She wrote the confession, and sent a note telling
me to copy and sign it.”</p>

<p>The reverend Father then said, “Give me her
note.”</p>

<p>I said, “I cannot, for she told me to send it
back to her directly I had read it, and I did so.”</p>

<p>He then turned to her, and she put on the
most innocent face, looking at the same time
aghast at me, and groaned:</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, shaking her head, as if it was
too awful to listen to me. After a great deal of
talking on their part, I was finally dismissed with:</p>

<p>“Poor child! She is not accountable for anything
she says. She is quite possessed.”</p>

<p>These words from Father Ignatius, who I thought
would at last see how unjust she was to me, caused
me deep grief.</p>

<p>This was by no means the first time I had a
false confession to copy, and send as my own.
Mother Cecilia (the Novice-mistress) once gave me
a confession, in her writing, to copy and send to
the reverend Father. I read it, and then knelt
down, and kissed the hem of her dress, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am very sorry, but I cannot write this, as it is
untrue.”</p>

<p>Her reply was, “You can do anything you are
told.”</p>

<p>I then knew that I <em>must</em> obey, and therefore I
wrote at the end of the confession:</p>

<p>“Dear Father, this is not true, I have only
copied it.”</p>

<p>I sealed the letter, and was going to send it, but
Mother Cecilia took it, read it, and severely lectured
me, saying:</p>

<p>“You have not a spark of the spirit of obedience
in you.”</p>

<p>She often told me to do or say what was not
true, and I could not, and often I used to cry and
say:</p>

<p>“Mother mistress, I really do want to be obedient;
but that is not true, and I cannot write it.”</p>

<p>“No,” she would tauntingly reply, “I know you
cannot. You have plenty of sense, you are quick
and clever, etc.; but there is one thing you cannot
do. You cannot give up your will, you cannot do
as you are told. Therefore you cannot be a nun.”</p>

<p>The truth was, that they did not want me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
become a fully professed nun, because, as such, I
should have had a voice in the community; and
having been with Father Ignatius so long, I was
not afraid of him, and used to speak about everything
to him, and let him know what otherwise
he would not have known. In order, then, to gain
their own ends, they must first lower me in his eyes,
and prove by all manner of intriguing that I had
“no vocation.” After four years they succeeded
in convincing him of it, and he finally told me
I had no vocation for the “religious life.” He
must have been very slow of discernment not to
have found that out before, considering that I had
been a sister for seventeen years.</p>

<p>I trust all this will not appear wearisome to my
readers. I hope that this book will be read by many
who may possibly have very little idea of what
convent life is. On the surface convent life has a
great attraction for some minds. When we were
in Devonshire, a girl of the name of Lily W., who
lived just opposite the convent, was desperately in
love with it, having seen all the glitter and outside
show, and heard the sweet music and singing, and
having seen the bridal ceremony of Sister Ermenild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
taking the white veil, and observed the peaceful
looks of the nuns whom she watched walking in
the garden. I would observe here, that what
<em>appears</em> a peaceful look is simply an attitude that
rule drills us into. Now, Lily W. thought that
convent life must be heaven upon earth. This girl
came to us at Llanthony, but she received a very
cold welcome. She was given plenty of hard work,
was taken no notice of, and had to keep silence
all day, like the professed novices and nuns, except
during recreation hour. When she had been there
three days, she said to me:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! it is all so different from what I
thought.”</p>

<p>She spent her days and nights in sighing and
crying, and seemed so miserable that I remarked to
the Prioress:</p>

<p>“Poor Lily seems so miserable, and she is
always crying and sighing, more or less, day and
night.”</p>

<p>The Prioress replied, “Serve her right; she
should not have pushed herself into a hornet’s
nest. If people will push themselves into a hornet’s
nest, they must expect to be stung.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Nuns have said to me more than once: “If it
were not for my vows, I would not stay in the
convent another day.” Another has said to me:</p>

<p>“Alas! I often look round and think can <em>this</em> be
what I gave up my beautiful home for? If ever a
woman came into a convent with a sincere desire
to serve God, I did.”</p>

<p>And I am sure she spoke the truth. Afterwards
she became a hard and tyrannical woman; but it
was not her fault; for convent life does one of two
things—it either crushes, or hardens its victims.</p>

<p>I assure my readers that convent life must crush
every bit of self out of its victims. I was crushed
by the life, and not seldom felt inclined to drown
myself.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>DAILY ROUTINE AT LLANTHONY.</i></span></h2>

<p>At 1.45 every morning the sisters are called by
the words, “Benedicamus Domino.” Each
sister must instantly arise, saying, “Deo gratias,”
then prostrate herself and kiss the floor; and after
tidying herself, she must kneel upright with her
back toward the bed, in silent prayer, until the
first chime of the bell ceases. The nuns then form
themselves into a procession, with lighted tapers
in their hands, and sing as they go to church,
where they remain, singing, praying, and reciting
psalms, etc., until 4 a.m. They then retire to their
cells, and rest until quarter to five (unless they
have the lamentations of Jeremiah to recite, or it
is Lent, for during that season they remain in
church from 2 to 6), when they are again
awakened by the same words, and have the same
routine to perform. Then follows the office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
“Prime.” If a priest is there, mass is said, or
sung, after which the “Martyrology” follows, and
“prayers for the faithful departed.” We then
remain in silent meditation until the Angelus
bell is rung, when we sing the “Angelus,” and then
form in procession and go to spiritual reading till
8. At that hour the bell calls us to church again,
when we recite the offices of Terce and Sext, and
listen to a meditation. At 8.45 the “Pittance
bell” rings, and we form in procession again, and
go into the refectory, where we find half-a-pint
of unsweetened coffee, some dry bread, potatoes,
rice or porridge, and salt, some of which we <em>must</em>
eat, whether we are hungry or not. Many a time,
like David, have we mingled our bread with weeping,
and well nigh washed our bed with tears. Of
course, the rule about eating this pittance of a
meal did not apply to the Superiors, for they had
whatever they liked, and had it whenever they
liked.</p>

<p>At 9 o’clock the bell again rings, and we go to
the Sacristy and sing, “Veni, Creator.” After this
the work of the day commences, and real hard
work it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>But at 12 o’clock (midday) the bell is again rung,
and we go to church and sing the “Angelus,” and
listen to a meditation on the blessed Sacrament
from St. Alphonsus Liguori, etc. We then come
out of church and go to chapter, where each sister
accuses herself of any fault against rule. Should
a sister omit anything, or her fellow-sisters
consider she has not told everything, it is their
duty to say, “I accuse sister so-and-so of doing, or
saying, or leaving undone, such a thing.” It may
be true or false, but the person accused cannot
justify herself, while the sister who has accused
her is praised for doing so, and is told that it wants
great courage to perform such a kindness to her
sister. Sometimes (more often than not) the
Superior will keep the sisters there an hour or two
accusing some sister, whom she has some special
spite against, of faults she never committed or even
thought of, and the least transgression of rule is
severely punished; while want of true charity, and
the Superior’s temper, are highly praised as in
accordance with the will of God.</p>

<p>Besides these daily “chapters,” each day we had
to write down every transgression of rule, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
present the record to the Novice-mistress every
Saturday morning. If she felt inclined, she would
write two or three more pages of our sins, which
of course she knew nothing about. Then she
would pass these confessions on to the Mother
Prioress, who would do a little more scribbling,
and then, in turn, pass them on to the reverend
Father, who would often write underneath, “Most
disgraceful,” and keep us away from Sunday Communion,
and return our books on Monday morning
to commence the same thing over again. Chapter
being over, we went back to work till three, when
the bell rang again for nones.</p>

<p>At 3.30 the dinner bell rings, and we all formed
in procession, said a long grace, and then sat
down to our meal, consisting of fish or eggs,
vegetables, pudding, or soup, and water. On
Sundays we had chicken and pudding. Flesh
meat (with this exception) was not allowed except
for the Superiors, who had it every day, or twice
or even three times a day, except Friday.</p>

<p>At 4 o’clock, the “recreation” bell rings, and
again we formed in procession, and recited a
prayer, offering the silence of the day past to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
God. And now we all must talk, even though
we may have nothing to speak about. If we
keep silence for five minutes, we are supposed to
be in a temper, and the erring sister is told to
go to her cell till she is sent for. At 5 o’clock,
the bell again rings; we form in procession, and
go to church, and sing Vespers and the “Angelus.”</p>

<p>At 6 o’clock the tea bell rings. Tea consists
of bread-and-butter, or jam, or treacle, and tea.
At 6.30 the bell again rings for conference
(“Lives of the Saints”).</p>

<p>At 7.30 the bell rings for compline, which
often lasts till 9 o’clock, for there is compline
to sing, <cite>De Profundis</cite>, prayers for the dead,
litany of the blessed Virgin, and hymn and
prayers to our holy Father St. Benedict, meditation,
and the closing hymn, after which we
go in procession, singing “Ave, Maria,” to the
dormitory, when each sister, kneeling at the
entrance of her cell, closes her eyes, and sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mother of Jesus, night is come,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And wearily we fall to sleep;</div>
<div class="verse">Ask Him to guard our cloister home,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">From powers of ill His flock to keep.</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Ave, Maria; Ave, Maria; Ave, Maria.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>We then undress, perform our ablutions, redress,
praying at each holy garment we put on; finally
we lie down, making the sign of the cross, and
saying, “I will lay me down in peace,” etc. The
“peace” is a query. It was more often “I will
lay me down in sorrow,” worn out in mind and
body, and thus closes the peaceful, perfect, sublime,
happy, holy day!</p>

<p>In summer the rule differs a little, and is not
quite so strict. But during the season of Lent
it is much stricter, and we only have the 9
o’clock pittance, and one meal at 5 o’clock,
and we actually rise in the morning at 1.45,
and do not rest any more till night. On Ash
Wednesday we had nothing to eat or drink until
six o’clock in the evening; we stayed in church
practically the whole of the day. The floor of
the church is strewn with ashes and cinders from
the grates, and we sit on the ground in the
ashes instead of in our stalls.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The 6 o’clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
meal is scarcely touched, as every one is feeling
too cold and ill to eat. After compline we have
to lash ourselves with the “Discipline,” and then
we have to go to bed unwashed, as a penance for
our sins. We are not even allowed to shake the
ashes out of our serge habits before retiring for
the night; to do so would be to break solemn
silence, so we actually sit in ashes all day, and
sleep in them all night. On Good Friday we go
through a somewhat similar day, but the ashes
are dispensed with. Every day, over and above
the divine office and prayer, continual supplication
for the conversion of sinners, and for the dead,
are offered, each person taking an hour’s watch
before the reserved Sacrament, so that the church
is not left from 5 a.m. till 10 or 11 p.m.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>ILL-TREATMENT OF CHILDREN.</i></span></h2>

<p>I recollect how a poor orphan boy at
Llanthony monastery was almost always in
disgrace, and had to endure the “Discipline.”
The lads, when doing penance, were stripped,
then laid on a long table, their faces downwards,
and lashed for such faults as talking in silence
time, slamming doors, leaving dust about.</p>

<p>Another little boy, of nine or ten—motherless—his
father a dipsomaniac, after being at the
monastery four or five years, was turned out and
sent to London, to do the best he could, with
only 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in his pocket. Father Ignatius said
Bertie was a perfect little devil. But I can
assure the reader that the end of all the boys
was very much like this. Sooner or later they
are turned out, or else they run away. The
two mothers at the Llanthony convent were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
constantly dropping down on the boys, when
Father Ignatius was away, for breaking solemn
silence, and made even the youngest of them
recite the Psalms aloud, after they were tired out
by the long service of compline. Very little
children, I know, had constantly to go without
their breakfast as a penance. I remember well
two dear little children, Ada and Alice ⸺.
They were sent to the convent by their father,
a tradesman in Hereford, who doubtless thought
it a great privilege to have them there. Alice
was only between three and four years of age.
Mother Mary Ermenild had charge of them, and
she would lash them both with the “Discipline”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
for the most trifling offences. I often found little
Alice holding her arms and crying, and would
say to her (if no one was near to hear me):</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, darling?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>She would hold up her little red arms, and sob:</p>

<p>“Mother Ermenild gave me the ’splin” (she
could not say “Discipline”).</p>

<p>Little Ada, too, would constantly be carried
to her cell, which was next to mine, and there
laid on the bed, and lashed on her bare flesh by
Mother Ermenild. When the child cried, she
would say:</p>

<p>“If you don’t stop that noise, I will give it
to you harder.”</p>

<p>Then another lash would come, and then
another scream, after which she would say:</p>

<p>“Are you going to make any more noise?
because I will give it to you again, if you are!”</p>

<p>The child would say:</p>

<p>“No, Mother,” and would try to smother her
sobs in the bed-clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Once, being in my cell, I heard this Mother
scolding Ada dreadfully, as a naughty, wicked,
disobedient little girl, for touching the ink and
spilling a little (poor child! she had been trying
to write a letter to her father, whom she worshipped).
The Mother then made this dear child
lie down, and she gave her seven lashes with the
“Discipline” on her bare flesh, in all forty-nine
cuts. Later in the day I went to look at the table
expecting to find it spoilt, but there was only one
spot of ink on it, about the size of a pea. On
another occasion I heard her lashing this poor
child, who shrieked so loud that I could not
endure it, and I ran to her, calling out:</p>

<p>“Oh, you—oh, you⸺”</p>

<p>I felt so angry that I did not know what to
call her; but I was reported to the Lady Prioress,
and sent for, and severely reprimanded for daring
to interfere, and take a child’s part, and call
Mother Ermenild names for punishing and penancing
the child. I was forbidden ever to speak
to the children again on any pretence whatever.
This was a great trial to me, for I loved the
children dearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, when Mother Ermenild first came to the
convent, she was a sweet and gentle girl, but she
was first crushed by the life she led, and then,
when power was given her, she became as hard
and tyrannical as the Novice-mistress and the
Dame Mary Wereburgh.</p>

are there present in the reserved Sacrament
in the tabernacle.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Rule 10.</i>—If we have a tendency to criticise a

unjustly accused of any fault, unless it be necessary
for God’s glory that the true offender should
be discovered.</p>

<p><i>Penance.</i>—Same as 18.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>N.B.—Our Superiors never did think it for
God’s glory that we should give any reason
or explanation (so that this part of the rule
is nothing else than a farce). Under this
rule they would keep us on our knees for
hours.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Rule 20.</i>—To receive the words of our Superior
humbly kneeling.</p>

sister for any length of time our Superior likes to
appoint.</p>

<p><i>Rule 22.</i>—To zealously observe our distribution
of work, and to do so wholly to the glory of God,
keeping before us the memory of eternal years,
our reasons for entering holy religion, and so to
glorify God and benefit His holy Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Penance.</i>—To lose our recreation.</p>

<p><i>Penance.</i>—If we broke this rule by getting
attached to a picture, or any other trifle, our
Superiors would deprive us of it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>N.B.—If we had anything they especially
wanted, they would take it from us, as they
had (so they said) noticed us breaking the
rule; and of course we dared not murmur,
as that would be transgressing our vow
of holy poverty.</p>

</div>

<p>The last two of the forty-nine rules are as follows:</p>

<p><i>Rule 48.</i>—To read over these observances each
day, with the <em>intention</em> of making them known
to our Superior at the close of each week.</p>

<p><i>Penance.</i>—To write out the whole of these forty-nine
observances at recreation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rule 49.</i>—In confessing our breaches of these
observances to state them thus, <i>e.g.</i>: “On Sunday,
I transgressed observance ⸺ by secretly feeling
annoyed at being told to do such and such a
thing. Jesus only.—‘They shall go from strength
to strength, until they all appear before God
in.…’”</p>

<p>These forty-nine observances (with their penances)
were given to us by the abbot, and written
out for us by him, with about forty-nine others.
The Superiors being above the rule, there is no
occasion for them to keep them, though they are
very, very strict in seeing that their subjects do
so, and were always dropping down on us at
every nook and corner, and making out that we
had broken them, when all the time we were
trying our best to keep them.</p>

<p>We were the slaves; they were the taskmasters,
and very hard ones too.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>OF WHAT RELIGION IS FATHER IGNATIUS?</i></span></h2>

<p>I have often been asked this question, and in
some respects it is not a very easy one to
answer, because Father Ignatius has such a wonderful
way of being all things to all men. He
has stood on the platform and preached by the
side of General Booth’s wife, and has joined in
their processions. He has himself told me that
he has gone to a Roman Catholic Dominican
monastery, and was welcomed there by the
monks under the designation of the “Abbot
Ignatius.” He has himself told us not to let poor
ignorant Roman Catholics know there is any
difference between us and them, as they will not
know the difference unless they are told.</p>

<p>Whilst we were bid to read the Bible, yet we
were taught to regard it as giving a clear proof
that the monastic life is the highest life on earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and our Lord’s example for such a life was ever
put before us: we were taught that He was an
enclosed monk from the age of twelve until thirty,
when He commenced His public life, because there
is not a word mentioned in the Bible about Him
during this period. This was supposed to afford
a clear proof that the life of a monk or a nun is
much higher than that even of a sister of mercy.</p>

<p>Though we were allowed to read a non-Roman
Catholic Bible, yet with regard to other books we
went to Rome for them; such as: “The Life of
St. Teresa,” “Life of St. Gertrude,”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> “Life of St.
Mary Magdalene of Piazzi,” “Life of St. Catherine
of Sienna,” “Life of St. Thomas Aquinas,” “Life
of St. Alphonsus Liguori,” “Life of the Curé de
Ars,” “The Diurnal of the Soul,” “The Glories of
Mary,” and “The Paradise of the Earth.”</p>

<p>Many other books from the same source, too
many to enumerate here, were given us by Father
Ignatius (and truly a man is known by his books),
or were read with his sanction.</p>

<p>He did not approve of one thing which St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Thomas Aquinas taught; namely, that if a
Superior should teach what is sinful or contrary
to God’s law, the obedience would be illicit, and
the nun would not be breaking her vow if she
refused to obey. Father Ignatius taught us that
he himself could not command what was wrong,
because he was the father and founder of the
revived monastic life in the Church of England. I
cannot put this matter any plainer, for I never
could quite understand what he meant, but I did
foolishly believe he could not tell us to do wrong,
because he said so, and for no other reason whatever.
Our Office Book, too, was the Roman
Catholic “Benedictine Breviary,” and for years the
Roman Catholic “Ordinary of the Mass” was
used at the altar. Lately Father Ignatius has
taken a fancy to use the Sarum missal, which
seems more elaborate than the Roman ritual. The
High Church party is not in great favour with
him, and, as a good many of them ignore him,
they are put down as “namby pamby.”</p>

<p>The nuns were and are (when there are sufficient
to perform the ceremony) to be called
“Nuns of the Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Sacrament.” At present this perpetual adoration
is, as a fact, only for certain times and great
festivals. I will attempt to describe it.</p>

<p>The altar is for the occasion adorned with
about 105 lighted candles. These are intermingled
with vases of exquisite flowers. I have
known them to cost £60.</p>

<p>The “Sacred Host” is always in the tabernacle;
but on these days, when the altar is
decorated out so finely, the Host is put into a
Monstrance, and enthroned amidst lighted tapers,
flowers, jewels, and clouds of incense, and at the
sound of sweet music and singing (in Latin)
bottles of Eau de Cologne are poured over the
altar, to be, as he frequently said, “wasted on
Jesus,” like Mary’s alabaster box of ointment.
The tabernacle is of exquisite beauty and workmanship,
with crimson velvet curtains, looped up
with massive gold chains, over which is a real
diamond cross. The beautiful images of angels
have enough bangles hanging on their arms to
set up a jeweller’s shop with, and there is a
piece of cloth of gold used for the Host, on
which are many jewels; one small corner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
cloth alone has, I think, seventeen rings, which
formerly belonged to a certain sister. The boys
on this occasion are clothed in scarlet cassocks,
each with a white cotta, trimmed with lace; the
abbot himself appears in gorgeous apparel, as also
those who assist him. The nuns used to wear
long white veils down to the ground, over which
were their crimson veils, used only during the
adoration of the Host, with long trains. Though
these are attractive-looking, yet the weight of
about twelve yards of material hanging from the
head is anything but pleasant, especially in hot
weather; and what with wearing these veils,
inhaling the incense, and singing with all one’s
power for two hours or more, I generally had
a very bad headache.</p>

<p>After the service called “Exposition of the
Blessed Sacrament,” all leave the chapel, except
the monk or nun who remains to take the watch.
After this one has remained motionless in
prayer for an hour, the great abbey bell (which
was consecrated to and named St. Bernard) tolls
five strokes, when everybody (no matter where
or in what occupation) must kneel down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
say, “Blessed and praised at every moment be
the most holy and divine Sacrament.” Then
some one else takes the watch before the
reserved Sacrament for another hour, and this
goes on all the day, which closes with the most
solemn and gorgeously bewildering “Benediction
of the Sacrament,” more so, I verily believe, than
in any Roman Catholic Church in England.</p>

<p>At Christmas the Bambino is the first object
of worship and adoration. This Bambino is a
beautiful figure of a baby, for which (I have
been told) eighty guineas were paid. This
figure is laid in the manger at midnight of
Christmas, amid much ritual and ceremony,
after which we all formed in procession, with
lighted tapers, veiled in our crimson veils, to kiss
the feet of the holy Child, which adoration we
also performed about nine times on Christmas
Day, and every day afterwards until the
octave of the Epiphany, though not so frequently
as on Christmas Day.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>As seculars are not allowed within the precincts
of the monks’ or nuns’ choir, the right reverend
Lord Abbot, vested in cope and mitre, holds the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
baby in his lap at the grating, for the faithful laity
to pay to it their adoration. If the Abbot should
not be there, the Mother Superior, Mary Wereburgh
(otherwise Mrs. B.⸺), represents the Virgin
mother, robed in a cope of white satin or silk.</p>

<p>We were not taught to believe in the infallibility
of the Pope. Father Ignatius had been
to Rome and kissed the Pope’s toe, and was
very proud of it too. There was no need to
believe much in the Pope, for Father Ignatius
and the Lady Prioress were practically our two
infallible Popes.</p>

<p>Neither were we taught the doctrine of the immaculate
conception of the blessed Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>I think, with these two exceptions, we were
identical in doctrine with the Church of Rome.
And now I leave it to my readers to decide for
themselves as to what is the religion of Father
Ignatius.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>MY DEPARTURE FROM LLANTHONY.</i></span></h2>

<p>The morning for my departure at last arrived.
One of the first thoughts that came to me
was, “I wonder if, after all, I am mad, as they tell
me I am? Perhaps I am, and that is the reason
for my leaving.” In solitude on that morning I
made a cup of tea, feeling too ill to eat, but I cut
a small portion of bread and butter, in case I
should want it. No one came near me. I thought
I should much like to say good-bye to some one,
but I dared not speak, for it was a period of
solemn silence. But I still had no small attachment
to the “Novice-mistress,” and would have
stayed in the convent had I only the assurance
that I should be permitted to live in peace, for I
had been a sister so long, and (strange as it may
appear) the life itself had still a certain fascination
for me. I did not <em>then</em>, as I do <em>now</em>, so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
blame the system, but those who treated me so
strangely, and often with cruelty.</p>

<p>At last I went into the community room, where
I knew I should find the Mother-mistress. On
seeing her, I approached her and put my arms
round her neck, and was about to kiss her, when
she shook me off as if I had been a viper. Had
she spoken but one kind word then, my courage to
leave might have been seriously shaken. But now
hot tears rushed to my eyes. I looked straight
into her face, and knew I had made no mistake.
A few minutes after this she sent me a note:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Child</span>,</p>

<p>I could not wish you good-bye; the reverend Mother
had forbidden me to do so, or even to come near you.</p>

</div>

<p>It was a cold, clear, bright frosty morning, when
I left the monastery at 7 o’clock. I was driven
down that beautiful valley, and how I enjoyed that
drive! To my surprise, my conscience did not
accuse me of sin in thus leaving. The morning
air seemed to clear my brain, and I knew with a
happy certainty that I was not mad; a feeling of
peace with God seemed to fill my soul. Such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
peace I had not experienced for a very, very long
time—so calm, so soft and sweet, so free!</p>

<p>It was sixteen years and a month since I took my
first journey to a convent, and I had not taken a
journey since, except when we went to Devonshire,
and from Devonshire to Llanthony, and then we
saw nothing, being in closed carriages, and having
strict orders not to raise our veils from our faces.
Those veils were thick and heavy, covering our
faces, and reaching down far below the chin.</p>

<p>But I must return to my narrative. I have explained
elsewhere, I think, that the Prioress would
not allow any of my letters to be sent to my sister,
in which I had asked for journey-money, and requested
that she would meet me, and give me instructions
as to my best way of finding her. None
of my letters were ever sent. When I left home to
go for the first time to the convent, my sister was
about seventeen years of age. Since then she had
married, and was living near Gloucester. Knowing
so little about the world outside a convent,
I fancied that if I only asked for a ticket
to Gloucester, I was certain to find my sister.
Accordingly, when we arrived at Llanfihangel, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Wales, I booked to Gloucester. On my arrival I
asked the first man I saw with a fly to drive me to
the post office, as I thought my sister lived near it.
Just as I was getting into the fly I thought I had
better tell the driver the name of the place where
my sister lived. He replied that he had never
heard of such a place; so I inquired at the booking-office,
and found I must take the train to a
place some miles beyond Gloucester. On my
arrival at this place I went outside the station (it
was now dusk) and saw what seemed to me a
stage-coach, and requested that I might be driven
to the post office. When I told the driver the
name of the place, he said he could not take me
all the way there. “I will take you,” he said, “as
near to it as I can, and you will then have to walk
a few miles farther on.” My readers may imagine
what a terror I was in. I began to fancy myself
put down in a lonely country road, with no house
near, darkness reigning, and all this experience
coming to one who had been shut up in convents
for so many years. What was I to do? I was
frightened at every one I met, and as to a <em>man</em>, I
feared the whole race. As I was thinking that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
best plan would be to try and take the next train
back to Wales, I saw a carriage passing near
me, in which was a sweet, gentle, pale-faced lady
in mourning. I ran to the carriage, and said to
the lady, tears streaming down my cheeks:</p>

<p>“Oh, will you please take care of me for a night,
for I am looking for my sister, and cannot find
her?”</p>

<p>She said: “Dear child, you cannot come with
us. Who are you?”</p>

<p>I replied: “I cannot tell you who I am.”</p>

<p>I was so afraid of saying I was one of Father
Ignatius’s nuns, knowing that the newspapers
might be full of it shortly, and that I should be
bringing trouble on Ignatius, and scandal on
religion.</p>

<p>A gentleman now came up to me and told me
to be off, speaking very roughly to me. Again I
appealed to the lady, assuring her I would go
away and look for my sister directly the morning
came, if only she would take care of me for this
one night. The gentleman again told me to be
off. But the lady spoke for me, saying:</p>

<p>“We can’t leave the poor child here, like this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt grateful to her, though it seemed useless
to appeal again. Just then a still, small voice
seemed to whisper these words to me: “Never
mind; you are my child; I will take care of you.”
I stopped crying at once, and, looking up to the
lady, I said:</p>

<p>“Thank you so very much for being willing to
take care of me, but never mind; I am God’s
child, and I know He will take care of me.”</p>

<p>These words were hardly uttered when the
gentleman said, “Jump up.” I looked in surprise,
and could not think where I was to jump to, but I
found he wanted me to jump up and take a seat
by the coachman; but I could not manage this, as
I was tired, ill, and worn out, and I had scarcely
tasted food for two days. The gentleman, seeing
my inability, kindly assisted me, and I was taken
care of until I eventually found my sister, who was
glad enough to see me. But I was so frightened
at every one. Directly I heard a knock at the door
I used to run up to my bed-room, in case any one
should see me, so strong was the force of the
habit I had acquired at the convent. My sister
thought it disgraceful that I should have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
allowed to come out of the convent without even
a change of clothes, especially so when Father
Ignatius had begged my own dear mother to give
me up to him for the service of God, and after
working as I had done for all those years. I
explained that Father Ignatius was on one of his
preaching missions, and knew nothing about my
leaving. She told me to write and ask for some
money. Father Ignatius sent me two pounds, with
which he expected me to buy clothes, to settle
myself in life, to pay my journeys, and purchase
any other necessaries I might require. Two
pounds! Less than half of what he has paid, or
allowed others to pay, to purchase one cowl for
a monk to wear at meal times and in church; less
than the sum he has spent to give the Prioress
and Novice-mistress Christmas presents! Two
pounds, after sixteen years of hard work!</p>

<p>I stayed with my sister about three months,
until I was a little less frightened, and then went
to my sister in London. I had to be provided
with every article of clothing, for the habit in
which I came forth from the convent I had worn
for about six winters. I was naturally careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and liked to make my “religious” dress last a long
time. One habit I had worn for nine summers, so
really I was never an expensive or extravagant
nun.</p>

<p>At this period, my thoughts often went out to
my first Mother Superior at Feltham; I longed
to see her, but for some time I felt afraid to go to
her or even to write, as Father Ignatius had said so
much about the members of the Feltham convent
being under God’s curse, and had made us think
that any one who held communication with them
would be committing a grave sin. At last, however,
I summoned sufficient courage to write and
tell her that I had left Llanthony. She wrote me
a most kind letter, and asked me to go and see
her; this I did, and told her all my Llanthony
experiences. She seemed to take it for granted
that I was coming back to her, and even asked me
plainly <em>when</em> I thought of taking up my abode in
the community once more? I told her I had
never thought of doing so. I must frankly acknowledge
that I had a very deep affection for this
Mother Superior, and I did not like to disappoint
her, so I arranged to return, and after being there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
four days she allowed me to have the novice’s
veil, and promised that I might take the black veil
in six months’ time. I must confess that this
Mother, in comparison with the one at Llanthony,
was kindness itself. I never found at Feltham
that one sister is permitted to tyrannize over
another.</p>

<p>After I had been there about three months the
reaction came. I compared the two convents, and
actually (with shame I say it) was <em>mad</em> enough to
think that because the Feltham rule was not strict,
therefore the life could not be so perfect! Father
Ignatius’s sermons now seemed to come back to me
word for word, especially all he had taught me on
monastic obedience and the will of God. I kept
thinking it all over, and could not banish it from
my memory; I felt convinced that it applied
to me, that I had sinned by leaving Llanthony,
and was not doing God’s will by remaining at
Feltham. I found no rest till I had unburdened
my mind to the Feltham Mother, and I then
implored her to allow me to return. She thought
it nothing short of infatuation, and reminded me
of what I had told her of Mother Wereburgh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
However, she left me free to do what I thought
best, advising me first to write to my sister, and
to see her before leaving Feltham. My sister came,
but she could make no impression on me, and she
could not comprehend my conduct. Indeed, I must
confess I could not understand it myself; for I did
not want to return, yet a mysterious something
seemed to draw me, and force me on against my
own will. Some such experience as this occurred
to the Nun of Kenmare, for on page 29 in her
“Autobiography” I read: “I was to all appearances
a free agent, and I was still young, I had full
liberty of choice, yet I felt in some strange way,
as I have often felt since, that I had no choice,
that I was led or moved or influenced by some
exterior power.” So was it with me in my
infatuation for Llanthony: I could not help myself;
I seemed forced by an invisible yet very real
power, which I did not pray against, and therefore
yielded to.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>AT LLANTHONY AGAIN.</i></span></h2>

<p>IN the month of August, in the year 1885, I
found my way back to Llanthony. It was
dark when I arrived at the monastery, and on
reaching it I seemed, for the first time, to realize
all this return implied, and I now trembled at the
thought of going into the convent. I walked
round about the building for some time, and then
looked in at the kitchen window. The first sight
that came to my view was the Novice-mistress’s
face, and that of Mother Ermenild, whose face and
eyes, seemed swollen with crying. It was now
9 o’clock, and I was wondering as to the best
course for me to take. I dared not go into the
convent, I could not stay outside all night, and of
course I did not like to go to the monastery. Of
these three evils, I chose the latter, for I was not
afraid of Father Ignatius. He was always very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
kind to me, and would not have changed, had it not
been for the influence which the Mother Superior
exerted over him.</p>

<p>To the monastery porch I went, and pulled the
bell. A monk, whose face I could not see, came
down, and I asked for Father Ignatius. To my
surprise, I discovered that it was the reverend
Father himself who was speaking to me. He was
very kind, but told me I must go to the convent.
I told him I was too frightened to go. He then
asked me what I had come back for, if I was afraid
to go to the convent. I told him that I had intended
to re-enter, but when the moment came I
had not the courage. He then took me into the
Church, giving me the opportunity of telling him
why I had gone away. He did not give me one
word of blame, except about my going to Feltham,
and was most kind. He then left me, and
sent the Novice-mistress to me, who did not say
much; but the tone of her voice seemed to send
a chill through me. The day after, the reverend
Father again saw me and was very kind, and told
me he had given orders that I was to be treated
with the greatest kindness. For some few days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
accordingly I was kindly treated, and soon, at
my own request, I was received as a postulant. I
did not object to begin the life again from the
lowest step; in fact, I believed more firmly than
ever that “the nun’s life is the very highest and
nearest to God that any human being can live on
earth.” It was on a Sunday that I was received
back as a postulant. There were several strangers
in the Lady Chapel, and a clergyman from
Hereford.</p>

<p>On entering the church I saw on the altar steps
a <em>funeral pall</em>, and the black altar hangings that
are used for the dead. A cold shudder ran through
me as I wondered what they were there for. At
last Father Ignatius and his brother monks came
in and sang the “Adoremus in æternum sanctissimum
Sacramentum” (“Let us for ever adore the
most holy Sacrament”). Ignatius then turned to
the grille gates that divide the monks’ choir from
that of the seculars, and gave out that before the
little ceremony, which was presently to take place,
it might be advisable to give a little explanation
of the cause thereof. He said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>Our dear little sister has incurred excommunication by
holding communication with excommunicated members of
our Order, <i>i.e.</i>, people who have been cut off from our Society,
etc., etc.</p>

</div>

<p>The gates were then opened, a cloth was spread,
and I was told to prostrate myself upon it. The
burial pall was then placed over me, and some
prayers were muttered. On rising, Father Ignatius
gave me the blessing, and the excommunication
I had incurred was taken off me. I then went
through the same postulant’s service that I had
gone through nearly seventeen years before. After
this Father Ignatius preached a sermon, in which
he highly praised me, saying that I had endured
great temptations, which had caused me to leave
the convent, and that he only wondered I had not
left before, but that now I wished to return; and
he concluded by saying, “We hold out a loving
hand to her, for our dear sister has humbled herself,
and she shall be exalted.”</p>

<p>After this, I was again admitted into community,
and the Lady Prioress was for a time
kind to me.</p>

<p>On September 29th I took novice vows again,
and Father Ignatius promised me, if all went well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I should receive the black veil in six months’ time.
It was shortly after this that Ignatius went away
on one of his preaching tours, and directly he had
left the Prioress made me kneel at her feet, and in
her old, terrible voice inquired whether or not I
intended to submit to her, etc., etc. In wonder
and surprise at the sudden storm that was bursting
after so long a calm, I replied: “Yes, dear Mother,
indeed I do.” She haughtily replied, “That’s a
good thing; now we shall soon see.” From that
moment she was just as severe as ever in her
treatment of me. The more I submitted, the
more tyrannical she became. She subjected me
to all manner of petty insults and penances, even
in the presence of little children. I soon felt
convinced that it was quite useless for me to
submit or even to attempt to live in the convent
any longer. I could see plainly that she could
never forgive me.</p>

<p>After a while I wrote a note to her, as I was not
allowed to speak, in which, to the best of my
memory, I used the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If you will only let me rest in peace until Father
Ignatius comes back, I will then ask his leave to go, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
am convinced you do not wish me to stay, and will never
be satisfied, no matter how submissive I am. I am convinced
also that if you go on treating me with such severity,
I shall in reality become a lunatic, for my mind will not
continue long to bear this heavy strain.</p>

</div>

<p>After this note she left me alone, and did not
again worry me. When Father Ignatius came
home a few days before Christmas, he sent
for me on Christmas Eve. I went to him and
said:</p>

<p>“Dear Father, I am very sorry, but I cannot
live with reverend Mother. I do not wish to
give up serving God, or to break my vows; and
if you will send me to another convent, I will
gladly go, or to General Booth (Ignatius was a
great admirer of the Salvation Army). I don’t
mind where it is so that I am under obedience,
and serving God.”</p>

<p>He replied: “Well, I’ll think over the matter,
whether to write to Mr. Booth about you, or to
write to the Abbess Bertha, and to tell her that
you are a very dear child of mine, who has been
with me for a great many years, but that you
cannot get on with this reverend Mother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
ask her if she will take you under her charge
for a time.”</p>

<p>He spoke most kindly to me about it. I then
asked him if I might come to Holy Communion
on the next day (Christmas Day), to which he
replied:</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>Later on he wished me a happy Christmas,
though he must have known that my heart was
nearly breaking with sorrow and disappointment.
I asked no more questions about my leaving, as
he had promised to do all he could for me, and
I implicitly believed him, and was content to
wait patiently, asking no questions, striving to
do my duty, as a sister, to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>One evening, soon after this interview, he sent
me a note commencing, “Jesus only.”</p>

<p>“You are,” he wrote, “to take your habit off
to-morrow; you ought to have done so weeks
ago”; and he signed it “Ignatius, of Jesus,
Abbot.”</p>

<p>This note surprised me, for I had been patiently
waiting his pleasure all this time. Next morning
there were not any other clothes put into my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
cell, so I was obliged to put on the nun’s dress
again; but in order to show my willingness to
obey, I omitted to put on my scapular. When
the Novice-mistress saw me, she said:</p>

<p>“Go and put on your scapular at once. You
ought to be ashamed of yourself, causing such a
scandal in coming out like <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>I knelt down and kissed the hem of her holy
habit, and said:</p>

<p>“Mother-mistress, reverend Father said⸺”</p>

<p>But she would not let me finish the sentence,
and interrupted me by saying:</p>

<p>“I know quite well what the reverend Father
said; I read the note before you, and <em>when</em> you
are told to take your habit off you will do it,
and not <em>before</em>. Go and put your scapular on.”</p>

<p>I obeyed in silence, and I now knew I should
have to undergo a public scene. At 12 the bell
for a visit to the blessed Sacrament tolled out,
after the “Angelus” was sung in Welsh. Nuns,
monks, boys and girls, and seculars, were all
present in the Llanthony Church. Then Ignatius
spoke:</p>

<p>“Sister Agnes, come down to the grating.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>In fear and trembling Sister Agnes obeyed.
Then, in a sepulchral voice, Ignatius said:</p>

<p>“As in the days of old, after great long-suffering
and forbearance of our loving God, His patience
at last came to an end with His people, so at
last, after great patience and forbearance on the
part of her Superiors, they must ask Sister Agnes
to take off her veil and habit, and lay them on
the altar steps.”</p>

<p>I felt this so acutely, that I sobbed aloud:</p>

<p>“Will you please forgive me, dear Father, for
all and whatever I have done wrong.”</p>

<p>After which, in the presence of all, I took off
my veil, and laid myself down on the altar steps.
When I had become somewhat calm, I realized
that a trick had been played on me, and that my
Superiors had made me pass through this ordeal
in order to make others believe that I had been,
so to speak, suddenly cut off by the will of my
Superior, and not by my own free will.</p>

<p>In reality, I had quite of my own free will been
waiting for Ignatius’s sanction, and the result
of his letters to Mrs. Booth and the Abbess
Bertha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>During the above scene I reminded Ignatius
of his promise to write to the Abbess Bertha, but
he replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, but that was before I knew you were not
converted,—when I thought you were a child of
God.”</p>

<p>Now I thought I had been converted some
fourteen years ago, when I was made to realize
so fully that Jesus Christ was my personal
Saviour, and had determined, so far as I had
light, “to show forth the praises of Him who had
called me out of darkness into His marvellous
light.” Surely, I thought, had I not been converted,
I could never have endured all that I had suffered
during those long years of misery! And had not
Ignatius taught me that I could <em>best</em> glorify Him
who had washed me from my sins in His precious
blood by being a true nun? Then I believed that
this was the best way of glorifying God; but now
I know that I was under a great delusion.</p>

<p>This scene took place on a Saturday. On
Sunday Ignatius told me I must leave the
convent before 7 a.m. on the following morning,
giving to the reverend Mother orders to give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
£2, and to supply me with all necessary clothing.
I sent this message back:</p>

<p>“I do not need anything at all; but will the
reverend Mother please let me have the box of
clothes I brought back with me.”</p>

<p>After some hours the box was sent to me with
my clothes all turned about, and with the following
message:</p>

<p>“The reverend Mother was obliged to look over
your clothes, to see what you wanted.”</p>

<p>I found that she had put two old table napkins
full of holes, in the box, two old towels full of
darns, and two coarse tea cloths (which treasures
I keep to this day), a petticoat; and besides these
she gave me permission to keep a new habit. I
examined closely the contents of my box, and
found that a dictionary, a quantity of fine linen
and other things had been taken from it. I asked
her for the linen, saying that I had bought it
with money my brother had given me before I
returned. She sent back this message:</p>

<p>“Tell her I have taken nothing but what
belongs to me.”</p>

<p>I imagined she meant that as I had taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
vow of poverty, she had a right to give or retain
whatever she liked. After I had taken my
departure, I wrote for my things, but I never
received an answer.</p>

<p>This was the second time I had left convent
life, which had so often been described to me as
“angelic.” I had endured quite enough of its
misery.</p>

<p>It will be as well, before making the very few
remarks I am able to give on the alleged
“apparitions at Llanthony,” that I should give
my readers a few extracts from Father Ignatius’s
oration on the subject, which was delivered on
Tuesday evening, May 5th, 1885, at, as far as I
recollect, Westminster Town Hall. This oration
was based professedly on Hebrews xii. 1: “Wherefore
seeing we also are compassed about with so
great a cloud of witnesses,” etc. It would appear
from this oration that Ignatius looks upon the
alleged supernatural events at Llanthony as affording
witness to the truth of nineteenth century
Christianity. Let Ignatius tell his own story:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Apparition 1.</i>—On Monday, the 30th of August, 1880,
Brother Dunstan went as usual, at 9 o’clock, into the church
to take his watch before the blessed Sacrament. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
kneeling about twenty feet from the altar. At the south
side of the altar there is a large window, which was not then
filled with stained glass, and consequently a bright light
shone upon the altar. The brother who left the watch had
no communication with the sister who next came in to take
her watch. She (Sister Janet) had been a schoolmistress in
the neighbourhood for many years, and was now an associate
of our Order.</p>

<p>The brother had been half an hour at his watch, when he
raised his eyes and saw, in front of the tabernacle, a kind of
blue mist playing. As he looked at the mist, he thought that
his eyes must be affected, and he rubbed them, thinking it
was an illusion; but as he still looked, the mist thickened
and densified, until he saw the Monstrance, or silver vessel
which contained the Host, within the tabernacle glimmering
in the mist, outside the massive door of the tabernacle,
which was locked. This door is of iron, nearly an inch
thick. The key was in my cell, which I had not left that
morning because I had been very unwell, and had had a
good deal of writing to do.</p>

<p>The mist gradually cleared away, and then the sacred
vessel containing the Host was plain before the brother’s
eyes, and the sunlight in the window flashed upon it. He
saw this for half an hour, and, on leaving his watch, still
looked upon the vision as he went out.</p>

<p>Sister Janet then came in to take her watch, and knelt
down, as usual, at the screen in the outer church. When
she looked at the altar, she saw the same appearance; but
she did not dream of its being supernatural; she imagined
only that the blessed Sacrament was exposed for some
reason or other; but she was much astonished to find that
the Host was exposed without the usual signs of reverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and devotion which we always render when we have our
three expositions in the year.</p>

<p>We only have the Host exposed three times a year, and
they are very solemn occasions; and we pay our Lord a
great deal of honour during those days. On this occasion
there was no light burning, there were no flowers, and the
sister was consequently much astonished, knowing how
particular we are in these matters of detail and reverence.
Directly her watch was over at 11 o’clock she went to the
monastery porch, rang the bell, and asked to see the brother
who had taken the watch before her. When he came to the
grating, she said: “Why has the reverend Father left the
blessed Sacrament out?”</p>

<p>When she had explained precisely what she had seen,
and Brother Dunstan knew that the tabernacle had not been
opened, he at once came to my cell to tell me what had
happened.</p>

<p>I suggested that we should go to the church. When we
went in, the apparition had disappeared.</p>

<p><i>Apparition 2.</i>—In the evening (of the same day) after
vespers, the choir-boys were in the meadow playing. All at
once the noise of the game was stopped, and in a very short
time one of the boys came running up to my cell, soon
followed by others, saying: “Father, we have seen such a
beautiful spirit in the meadow.” The eldest boy, who was
fifteen years old, said he was certain that what they had
seen was the blessed Virgin Mary—quite certain. He said
that first of all, as he was waiting for his turn to run in the
game, he was looking towards an old ruined hut, where
there had been a farm-house, and he saw a bright light over
the hedge and the figure of a woman, with hands upraised
as if in blessing, and with a veil over her face, coming to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
him. He stood still, and was much astonished and alarmed.
The figure came almost at right angles to him, and then
she passed close enough even for him to see the material of
the garments that she wore. The figure passed off at right
angles, and stood in a bright light in a bush about fifty feet
from the boy. The bush was all illumined with phosphorescent
light. The figure passed through the bush, and the
light was there for some little time after the form had disappeared.
The rest of the boys saw and described the same
appearance.</p>

<p>I had all the boys in the church, where I spoke solemnly
to them, separately, and heard what they had to say. I told
them what an unlikely story it was, and that no one would
believe them; and I asked them what could have put it
into their heads to think such a thing.</p>

<p>But they still maintained that what they had said was
true.</p>

<p>We watched Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
evenings after that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I had to leave Llanthony on the Saturday,
being under a promise to take the duty for a clergyman in
the diocese of Exeter, where we had a convent at that time;
but I left strict orders that the brothers and boys should
watch every night at the same time, about eight o’clock, and
then write to me, telling of any experience they might have.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, Sept. 4th, the boys were out playing
as usual, when, all at once, the same bush became illuminated
with a very bright light. One boy called out, “The
bush is on fire again!”</p>

<p>For some time they watched the light; then they ran to
the monastery to call out an elder brother.</p>

<p>In the meantime a junior brother had come out, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
knelt down in the meadow before the illuminated bush, and
had begun to say prayers and hymns. The boys were indignant
because he was saying collects and hymns that had
no relation to what they considered the vision to be, and
they said: “Do not say those prayers, but say a ‘Hail,
Mary’; for we are certain it was the blessed Virgin. If we
do, our Lord will perhaps let the vision appear again.”</p>

<p>While they were discussing, the senior brother came up,
and he agreed that they should begin to sing “Ave, Maria.”
That instant the figure flashed again, in a cloud of light, in
the same place where the first boy had seen it on the Monday.</p>

<p>As they sang, the figure sent out rays of light, sometimes
appearing behind and sometimes in front of the hedge, and
sometimes coming straight towards the illuminated bush.
When they said the words in the “Hail, Mary,” “Blessed is
the fruit of thy womb—Jesus,” they saw a second figure as of
a man, with only a cloth round his loins, appearing in the
light, with his hands stretched out.</p>

</div>

<p>Father Ignatius returned from Devonshire to
Llanthony on Tuesday, September the 14th, and
on that night, he says, “we watched, but saw
nothing.” But, in the words of the oration,
Ignatius thus describes the scenes of the following
night:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On the 15th of September, between eight and a quarter-past
eight, we watched again. It was a very close, muggy
evening. There was a heavy Scotch mist descending, and
the mountains were looking very dull and the sky leaden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
It was so damp that we did not go into the meadow; but
Sister Janet, who was not allowed to come to the monastery
door where we were standing, went into the meadow.</p>

<p>We were in the monastery porch. The boys were
standing on the front steps; I was standing on the top
step; one brother was at my left, and another brother on
my right. Two farmers were behind in the back of the
porch; and a gentleman visitor—an undergraduate of Keble
College, Oxford, now in Holy Orders—was a little behind
me to the right.</p>

<p>I suggested that we should sing three “Hail, Mary’s,”
in honour of each person of the blessed Trinity. We began
a “Hail, Mary” in honour of God the Father.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Between
the “Hail, Mary’s,” we, all of us, expressed our amazement
at some very curious flashings of light, which we saw in
all directions in the meadow, like the outlines of figures.
That was the impression I had.…</p>

<p>I then said, “Let us sing a ‘Hail, Mary,’ in honour
of the blessed Virgin herself;” and we began to chant the
fourth “Hail, Mary.”</p>

<p>Directly we began to do so I saw a great circle of
light flash out over the whole heavens, taking in the mountains,
the trees, the ruined house, the enclosure, the
monastery, the gates and everything; the light flashed
upon our feet, upon the steps, and upon the buildings; and
from that one great circle of light, small circles bulged out,
and, in the centre of the circles, stood a gigantic figure of
a human being, with hands uplifted, standing sideways.</p>

<p>In the distance this gigantic figure appeared to be about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sixty feet in height; but as it descended it took the ordinary
size of a human being. At the moment it struck me that
a dark appearance over the head of the figure was hair,
not a veil; but I am convinced from comparing notes with
the others, and also from other reasons, that it was a veil
which I saw over the head.</p>

</div>

<p>Ignatius, after mentioning that the two brothers,
and Sister Janet had seen the same vision (he does
not mention whether the farmers saw it), said:
“From that time no further visions appeared.”</p>

<p>Two important reasons Ignatius then gave for
“our Lord” giving these apparitions.</p>

<p>1. “For the good of the Church of England.”</p>

<p>2. “For the comfort of those in the outer world.”</p>

<p>Father Ignatius, in his oration, gave an account
of his sending, a few days after this memorable
apparition, to each of his nuns at Slapton, in
Devonshire, “pieces of a wild rhubarb leaf, which
had stood up dark against the dazzling garments
of the apparition, as it appeared in the bush.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>He then went on to describe how a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
nun at Slapton, “a middle-aged lady,” who had
been a cripple for thirty-eight years, was healed
by applying the said charm to her diseased
limb. I will give you his own account of this
supposed miracle.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On Tuesday, Sept. 21st, 1880, just seven days after
the last apparition had been seen, she was quivering from
head to foot with pain. She was going to lie down without
lifting her diseased limb with the other limb on the bed,
when something told her to use the leaf, which she had
put, wrapped up in an envelope, in her pocket. She took
the leaf out. She took the rosary and said ten “Hail,
Mary’s”; and, at the end of the “Hail, Mary’s,” she took
the piece of leaf and laid it upon these painful abscesses.
The very instant the piece of withered leaf was laid upon
the abscesses they closed up and the discharge ceased; her
knee was loosened at the joint, her foot was on the ground,
and she was cured instantaneously.</p>

<p>The next morning she told and showed the reverend
Mother and her sister nuns the miraculous wonder of
God’s infinite goodness towards her; and the news quickly
spread in the village.</p>

<p>The vicar of the parish came to the convent, and the
village people rang the village bells, for they were very
fond of the nuns; and, in a day or two, there was a service
of thanksgiving in the Priory Chapel, for the miracle that
God had wrought. There was also an account in the local
papers of what had taken place.</p>

</div>

<p>Father Ignatius then mentions other miracles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of healing that were, he affirms, wrought by the
use of the withered rhubarb leaf. The following
words may be interesting to some of my readers;
they appear at the close of the oration:</p>

<p>To sum up, then:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A solemn, public testimony has now been given to a
most startling, supernatural phenomena, in a <em>Church of
England monastery</em>, in the midst of this unbelieving,
materialistic age.</p>

<p>By these phenomena the mysteries of Christianity have
been solemnly confirmed; and the Word of God has
received one more “<em>So be it</em>.”</p>

<p>The Church of England has been supernaturally recognised
as a true portion of the Catholic Church, and
her Sacraments acknowledged by a miracle.</p>

<p>The monastic revival, long persecuted<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> because of the
two special points above alluded to, viz., the restoration
of the reserved Sacrament, and the cultus of the mother
of our Lord, have now received a sanction from on High,
by these marvellous manifestations.</p>

<p>English Churchmen have received from God a special
approval for their ancient Church, in spite of her sadly
isolated position.</p>

</div>

<p>Having thus given, in Father Ignatius’s own
words, an account of the alleged apparitions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
miracles, I feel sure many will naturally ask me
for my opinion of them. My opinion is simply
this: I believe something was seen which Ignatius
really did believe to be supernatural, but which
appearance I firmly believe to have been nothing
more or less than a practical joke performed
by a certain young man, who never intended it
to be taken for anything supernatural, in the
serious manner with which it was taken.</p>

<p>With regard to the vision of the “Sacred Host,”
I simply do not believe it at all. I believe that one
of them imagined it, and told the other about it
in some way, and that that other was only too
ready to believe it. This is my firm conviction
about the matter, and I hope that as I am no
longer a nun I have not only the right to have
an opinion of my own, but also a right to express
it.</p>

<p>During my sojourn at Llanthony, I never saw
anything supernatural, although there were some
who ofttimes tried to work my mind up to such
a state, that it was with difficulty something of
the kind was not forced upon my heated imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>I recollect a somewhat ridiculous circumstance
in this direction, that occurred on the “eve” of
the “anniversary of the apparition of our Lady
of Llanthony.”</p>

<p>We were watching the procession of the Shrine,
and its accompanying and subsequent rites, when
suddenly the reverend Mother exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I see something; it’s moving!”</p>

<p>“Where?” I asked, “for I cannot see anything.”</p>

<p>The Mother then pointed to the “Abbot’s
Meadow.” There <em>was</em> something moving slowly,
and I watched for a few moments, and then said:</p>

<p>“Why, it is the cow, with patches of white on
her.”</p>

<p>And so it was, as she was obliged to acknowledge.
This Mother I believe often professed to
see visions, and dream supernatural dreams; and I
might have thought that I saw visions, but being
somewhat of an inquiring and matter-of-fact turn
of mind, I preferred to be very cautious, and carefully
sifted everything that had any appearance of
the miraculous about it. For instance, I was once
kneeling at the prayer-desk before the “altar,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
supposing myself to be quite alone in the church;
when I suddenly saw the curtains at the back
of the “altar” gently moving for some time, and
I wondered what this movement could mean.
Then all was all quiet again, and I resumed my
devotions, thinking that possibly I had only
fancied it. Suddenly, behind the flowers and
candlesticks, I beheld a face, and I began to
tremble, and feared even to look up again; but
at last I did so, and I beheld the reverend
Mother, who was, I believe, engaged in dusting.
Now if I had been half asleep, I might
easily have imagined I had seen a vision of a
departed saint; and I think the semi-darkness
in which the sanctuary was enveloped, together
with the soft rays of the ever-burning sanctuary
lamp, can with little difficulty lead the devotee
to imagine the supernatural, especially as we were
always taught that on the “altar,” that miracle
of miracles, or rather that imposture of impostures,
took place in the transubstantiation of the
bread and wine, into the body, blood, soul, and
divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>But to return to the apparitions, an account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of which I have already given, and about which I
have stated shortly my opinion.</p>

<p>I was at Slapton, in Devonshire, at the time
they took place, and therefore I only heard what
the boys had told Father Ignatius.</p>

<p>He asked us all: “Do you believe them?”</p>

<p>The other nuns said, “Yes.”</p>

<p>Father Ignatius then said: “Do you believe
them, Sister Agnes?” I replied, “No, dear
Father, of course I don’t. I never believe anything
the boys say.”</p>

<p>I had a particular dislike to the monastery boys,
and I had often heard from the reverend Father
what lying boys some of these very ones were,
and as to ⸺ he scarcely ever spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Then, as to poor Sister Janet, she was certainly
very eccentric and peculiar, and when any one
injured her she usually threatened to “call up
the ghost” of her dead father. She once thus
threatened a man, and a priest, knowing of it,
disguised himself, and frightened the poor man
so much, that he refused to go back to the hut
where he lived. Apart from this she had her good
points, and was Father Ignatius’s devoted slave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>As you will have noticed, the reverend Father
was at Slapton Convent during most of the
time when the said apparitions took place, and
he heard of the visions through the letters of the
brother at Llanthony, and I believe he was the
only brother at Llanthony at the time, and he was
but a novice-monk.</p>

<p>Father Ignatius read the letters to us, and I
hardly knew what to make of the matter; but
at last the reverend Father returned and saw for
himself the most marvellous and glorious vision,
after which I very naturally—considering my
state of mind at that period of my life—thought
it must be true, which in a sense was fortunate
for me, for on his next visit he again asked me if
I believed in it, and I remember well I replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly, dear Father, I do not doubt
<em>your</em> word.”</p>

<p>He then told us that he was determined that
no one should stay in monastery or convent who
did not believe in it.</p>

<p>And now a word or two about the story of
the “middle-aged lady,” otherwise the Novice-mistress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the account of whose miraculous cure I
have already given in the words of Father
Ignatius.</p>

<p>To begin with, that account differs somewhat
from the one I can give; but as I am matter-of-<em>fact</em>
in my statements, I think it best to give the
facts as I know them, for I was one of the
Slapton <em>nuns</em> at the time. Yes, I was a <em>nun</em> then,
although life-vows had not been pronounced by
me; I was what is termed a “life-vowed novice,”
that is, in making my vows I made them “until
the time of my profession.” But I have in a
previous part of this book explained that novice-vows
were to all intents and purposes well nigh
as binding as those made in full profession. I
merely give this explanation to show you the
position I was in at that period when at Slapton.
Father Ignatius, in his oration on the apparitions
speaks of me as a nun, for, in touching upon the
healing of the Novice-mistress in the Slapton
Convent, he said:</p>

<p>“Next she told and showed her sister nuns
the miraculous wonder”; <i>i.e.</i>, the withered
rhubarb leaf. Now, as a matter of fact, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
neither told the nuns, nor showed to them this
great wonder; she may have showed and told
the Mother Prioress, but no one else.</p>

<p>The Vicar of Slapton came to celebrate, and
spoke of the wondrous miracle which had taken
place in our midst. (I believe this was on a
Saturday, and the miracle of healing had taken
place on the previous Tuesday.)</p>

<p>Now, certainly we had been more or less with
her all this time, and yet we knew nothing about
it; so when the Slapton Vicar gave his address, I
was very puzzled to know what he meant.</p>

<p>When the celebration was over, and we had
come out of the Chapel, I asked:</p>

<p>“What did the Vicar mean?” and I said to
the Mother, “Have you really been cured
Mother mistress?” (It was then that I discovered
that only the Mother Prioress knew of it.)</p>

<p>“Yes; have you not noticed it,” she replied.</p>

<p>I had to confess that I had <em>not</em> noticed it, and,
what is more, I never did, for she still limped,
and still does. In fact, I once said, “Mother
mistress, is it not strange that our Lady did not
quite cure you? It would have been so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
nicer if she had!” She replied, “Yes, but I
must be grateful for what she has done.”</p>

<p>Now I really did then believe she had done
something, but what it really was I could not
make out, as I saw no difference in her whatever.
In fact, many times have I seen the poor nun
flushed with pain at the exertion of moving. Most
probably the abscess had run its course and
closed naturally just about the time when the
rhubarb leaf arrived; and as to the raising of
the limb which she had been unable to do for
thirty-eight years, we all know how easy it is
for some persons to imagine almost anything.
But all I have to say is, she was about the same
when I last saw her as when I first saw her;
and if any one went to see her, they would see
for themselves that she still limps. While she
was a novice, she had a bad attack, after which
a crutch was procured for her, which she used
once or twice, and then went back to her old
stick; but both crutch and stick had been given up
long before the apparitions, though occasionally
she would take the stick to go up the hill with,
to the summer-house (and I often wished I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
one, for it was a tiring climb). Nevertheless the
stick and the crutch are now laid at the “Shrine of
our Lady of Llanthony” as “<em>memorials of God’s
wonders</em>!”</p>

<p>I remember how I have looked at this stick
and crutch, and thoughts passed through my
mind which I need not mention.</p>

<p>Since I finally left the convent, I have been told
that a certain young man acknowledged to a
priest that he had enacted the whole of the
apparition with a magic lantern, and that the
priest had written to Father Ignatius, advising
him not to say anything more on the subject,
or else he would make known how the whole
thing came about, or words to this effect. Probably
the young man was the railway clerk,
who witnessed the boys’ excitement on the subject,
for nowhere do you hear of his having
seen the apparition himself. Doubtless he was
too busy amusing the others. Now I do not say
positively the apparitions were produced by a
magic lantern, but I was told so, and I think this
is the general opinion.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>LIBERTY.</i></span></h2>

<p>I cannot but add a chapter in which I
shall especially endeavour to give a word of
counsel and warning to all who may in any
degree be looking upon convent life, whether in
the Church of England or in the Church of
Rome, with a favourable eye. I may say sincerely
this book has been written with this object.
And if, in doing what seemed to me so bounden
a duty, I have hurt the feelings of any who
are mentioned in its pages, it was not with
the object of doing so that I was led to speak
out the truth. My prayer for them is that they
may be brought out into the same liberty that
I, through God’s infinite mercy, am now in the
enjoyment of. I can truthfully say that in doing
this I have fully counted the cost, and it <em>has</em>
already cost me no small amount of pain. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
spoken the truth, and I have endeavoured to do
so in no vindictive manner, but in love. Distinctly
this book has been written to warn all against
making the terrible mistake in life that I made.
Had I but listened to and obeyed my mother,
her advice would have saved me from wasting
(I can use no other word, though God will doubtless
overrule this mistake for my own good, and
for the good of others) the best and youngest
years of my life, and have prevented me from
enduring years of mental suffering and misery.
But when I went astray on the path that seemed
so attractive and pleasant, I was very young; I
was but fifteen years of age, and like, I fear, so
many young and inexperienced people, I was
foolish, self-willed, and fancied that I was better
able to judge for myself than others were to judge
for me. And so I was led to deliver myself over
to the tender mercies of High Church Fathers
and Mothers. I was simply bewitched by their
“fair speeches,” high professions of sanctity, and
solemn assurances of the happiness belonging to
the cloistered life.</p>

<p>When I think of such “false prophets,” I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
forcibly reminded of the words we read in 2
Timothy iii. 6:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Of these are they that <em>creep into houses</em>, and take captive
silly women, laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,
<em>ever learning</em> and <em>never</em> able to come to the knowledge of
the truth.</p>

</div>

<p>I was led by Ignatius to believe that by my
action I was doing God’s will, and that by leaving
my home and relations I was but obeying the
command of Christ to “leave all and follow Him.”
Was there ever such an absurdity as this? I was
not called to go on a mission to the teeming
millions living in heathen darkness, and take
to them the Gospel of God’s grace; nor yet
to work amongst the heathen in our own large
towns; but positively to make myself a prisoner
in one particular house, to be shut up where I
could engage in no Christian or even philanthropic
labour, and in <em>such</em> an isolated position
I was told over and over again that I could live
the highest, the holiest, and the happiest life on
earth, and withal, bring down to the world around
me blessings and health through the merits of
“holy obedience.” I was taught that I could bless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and be made a blessing to others, by “telling the
beads,” “invoking the saints,” “confessing sins to
man,” by “hearing mass,” and by “reciting
various offices.” What incredible folly!</p>

<p>On looking back, I find how great was my
delusion, and I do heartily trust that my experience
of this folly may be the means of saving
girls and boys, men and women, from wasting so
much precious and God-given time, which it was
my sad lot to lose. I sowed the seed of blind
enthusiasm, and reaped the harvest of untold
misery, and blighted hopes. All the high-flown
promises (which I so greedily swallowed) of the
joy, the glory, the peace, the happiness of the
nun’s life, are <em>false</em> promises and vain delusions.
Certainly at one of the three convents in which
I resided it was (as some of the sisters have
said) “like living in a bear-garden.”</p>

<p>I do from the depths of my heart thank God
for delivering me out of the “bear-garden,” and
I pray that He will deliver others, and give them
courage to “come out.”</p>

<p>It needs some courage to enter, but a hundred
times as much to leave. I fear in many convents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
humanly speaking, it is, after full profession,
almost an impossibility to do so, for, as I have
said, the moral bolts and bars are even more
difficult to break through than the material ones;
and these latter are, especially in Roman Catholic
convents, not few or easily to be broken through.
During all the years spent by me in nunneries
I cannot look back to <em>one</em> sister, and say I
know she is happy, that she has found <em>true</em> peace
and satisfaction; but I can recollect the many
who were disappointed at finding the life so
utterly different from what they had been led to
expect.</p>

<p>Alas! alas! When once we have taken up
the “golden plough,” there is virtually no “looking
back.” When once we have made our choice,
we must abide by it. Many I know bitterly
regret that they ever put their hands to this
golden or, rather, this <em>gilded</em> plough.</p>

<p>If nuns were only free, and not conscience-bound,
they would tell the self-same, true story
which I do. But alas! they dare not speak, they
even scarcely dare to think for themselves. Their
reason has been given up to their Superiors (do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
remember this), and they have no right to think
anything but what their Superiors think.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is not your place to think, but to obey.</p>

</div>

<p>These words were often spoken to us. And
again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A nun is always sure of doing God’s will, because her
Superior’s voice is God’s voice to her, and even should I,
your Superior, tell you to tell a lie (which of course I should
not), you would be committing the sin of disobedience if
you did not do as you were told.</p>

</div>

<p>I recollect well that a certain dear young sister
was told to tell what she believed to be a lie. She
was in great distress about it, and went to the
Mother Superior we then had, telling her that she
did not know what to do, as she must either commit
the sin of lying or of disobedience.</p>

<p>When a monk or nun is under vows, such a man
or a woman is but a <em>tool</em> to be used as the owner
of that tool sees fit. Individuality is sunk in the
order in which such vows have been made.
Practically, men and women under vows (and it
matters not whether these vows are made in the
established Church of England or in the alien
Church of Rome) are <em>dead</em>—dead to the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
dead to father, mother, sisters, brothers and
friends; above all, dead to the “still small voice”
of an enlightened conscience which once had power
to speak. Yes, they are <em>dead</em> in another sense
of the word, for have they not, knowingly or unknowingly,
committed an act of moral suicide?
They are no longer responsible beings. They
have given up their souls, their bodies, their wills,
their consciences and reason itself into the hands
of their Superiors, who from the moment those
terrible vows are taken are to them in the place of
God; and whatever command the Superior gives,
<em>that</em> must they obey without question and blindly.
And should one Superior give a sister over into the
hands of another (as was the case with me), then
that one must be obeyed with the same blind
obedience. We were taught by the Superior:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the order given is sinful, that is <em>my</em> sin, and you are
not responsible; but you would be guilty of greater sin in not
obeying, because it would be the sin of disobedience, and
God hates that sin more than any other, because it was the
sin that brought death into the world, and it will bring death
to your soul.</p>

</div>

<p>Such being the case, we may define a nunnery
as a place where slaves drag on a weary existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
day and night. Whilst the slave-owners do their
own sweet wills, we, their slaves, must idolatrously
bow down to them, kiss the hems of their holy
garments, and obey without a murmur. Murmuring
at our condition is most strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>Indeed, should the relatives or friends of a poor
nun go to the convent and there hold converse with
her, that conversation must be held only through
a grating, and (in our case, at any rate) the nun
must have her face closely veiled. And even then
it would not be possible to lodge a complaint with
one’s relative or friend, or even with one’s own
mother, since another nun is usually sent to listen.
Thus it is that we were often forced to appear
perfectly happy, when, in truth, we were just the
opposite.</p>

<p>I have had thus to appear when speaking to
my own sister; my heart at that time was well
nigh breaking. But should a nun complain, the
training she has gone through would cause her
to be very distressed in mind at having been unfaithful
enough to bring scandal upon the so-called
“religious life,” and she would feel bound
to confess it at once to her Mother Superior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>I should have written this account of my experiences
of convent life some two years ago, had I not
then feared that by doing so I should be doing
more harm than good, by exposing to the outside
world what a farce and sham some who make so
much profession are, to say nothing of what a
farce the whole system is.</p>

<p>But, little by little, I have become more free
from the chains which held me, and I now trust
that this book will do more good than harm by
saving others from being led away by the power
of Satan, for I believe it to be through Satanic
influence that this system exists. I sincerely hope
that this book will be read in the spirit in which
it is written, and that thus it will be the means of
saving many parents from heart-breaking separations
from their beloved children.</p>

<p>I would ask those who are not believers in
Christianity not to use it in order to bolster themselves
up in their atheistical views, or to see in it
a proof of the fallacy of true religion. Although
I have given up convent religion, yet I am a firm
believer in God. I believe that the Lord Jesus
Christ died and rose again to atone for and save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
His people from their sins, that the Holy Spirit
can and does give to all who believe in Christ
a new and a clean heart, and grace to walk in the
footsteps of the Saviour.</p>

<p>However misguided I was when I entered in my
convent life, yet I was induced to do so because I
had a deep love to my Saviour, and thought I
could not in a better way prove my love and
increase it.</p>

<p>But who can be surprised at a young girl being
deluded and led astray when “false prophets”
arise, who <em>profess</em> so much holiness and so great
and exact a knowledge of God’s will?</p>

<p>Many there are, like myself, who have been misdirected
and deceived by ritual, candles, flowers,
incense, gorgeous vestments, genuflexions, sentimental
music and sermons, and I know not what
other nonsense. I was seeking Jesus. I asked for
bread, but I was given a stone. For a time the
excitement arising from convent life made me
think I had found what I sought, but it was a
vain delusion, as I found to my cost.</p>

<p>There are in English convents to-day many
unhappy souls, groping in the dark. Are we to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
let them share my fate, and that of others, which
may be worse? Nay, rather let us use our pens
and voices to awaken and enlighten the men and
women of England as to the truth.</p>

<p>Others have exposed conventual life as it
exists in the Roman Catholic Church; but still the
people of England can scarcely be alive to the
fearfully rapid increase in the number of such
convents,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> or of the degrading and un-English and
un-Christian nature of the life of a nun therein.
It is not my lot to expose Roman Catholic convents;
the discoveries I have made have been
made in connection with the Church of England,
which, alas, through the fearful growth of Ritualism,
is becoming a recruiting ground for Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>My opinion may not be worth much, but I hold
the strong conviction that unless Protestants make
a great stir, and unless the bishops of the Church
set the example, England, at no very distant
period, will be Romanized.</p>

<p>I can point to more than two or three convents
in connection with the Established Church where
not only Roman Catholic books are in constant
use, but where the Roman Catholic Ordinary of
the Mass is used, instead of our own Protestant
Communion Service; and, worse than all perhaps,
I know the Mass was on several occasions celebrated
by a Roman Catholic priest in a Church of
England convent!!</p>

<p>When I came out of convent life and mixed
with Christian people, I discovered that the most
earnest workers were those who were in the enjoyment
of peace. They were living in the sunlight
of God’s love; they were, so to speak, good without
knowing it, they had no time to be always
thinking of themselves, but they were ever looking
to God. Now, in the convent it had been far
otherwise; we had been taught by man to try
with all our might to be good according to set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
rules, and ceremonies, and methods handed down
to us by Roman Catholic saints, or so-called
Fathers of the Church, and to be continually
examining and fingering our spiritual muscles to
see how we were getting on in the spiritual life.
In consequence of such a method, there was constant
failure, as there ever will be under such a
system.</p>

<p>I feel I have much to be thankful for that God
should have led me to see my mistake in life. It
was <em>His</em> work, for, in spite of the treatment I received,
<em>I</em> still clung to the convent life. My motive
for leaving it was mainly to get away from being
misunderstood and misrepresented, and from the
endurance of cruel penances. But since then my
eyes have been further opened, so that I now
totally disagree with the whole system, and I
thank God for having so providentially taken me
by the hand. He and He alone has delivered me
from so many Satanic delusions, and He and He
alone has made known to me the “truth as it is in
Jesus,” and not in Romish rites and ceremonies.
I can and do indeed rejoice in the liberty wherewith
Christ has made me free; I am free to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Him “without fear,” and I am free to let my light
shine that others may learn thereby to glorify my
heavenly Father.</p>

<p>I thank Him especially for not letting me remain
in the convent any longer, wasting time and
precious opportunities of doing good and helping
others. And I do pray that He will ever keep me
in a listening and waiting attitude of mind upon
Himself, so that I may “hear what the Lord will
speak: for He will speak peace unto His people,
and to His saints.” And may He so speak to me
that I may <em>never</em> “turn again to folly.”</p>

<p>That God may use these poor efforts of mine to
open the eyes of many, is the prayer of her who,
with the man whose eyes the Lord once opened,
can say, “Once I was blind, now I see.”</p>

<h2>DEVOTIONAL BOOKS USED BY SISTER MARY AGNES, O.S.B.</h2>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_A"><i>APPENDIX A.</i></h3>

<p class="hanging">“<span class="smcap">Manual of Devotions to our Holy Father, St.
Benedict, Abbot and Patriarch of the Western
Monks; to his Sister, St. Scholastica, Virgin
and Abbess; and to all Saints of his Order.</span>”
(London: Catholic Publishing and Bookselling Co.
Limited.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Ignatius calls himself a Benedictine monk, and his
nuns belong to the same order. One would have supposed
that though he imitated Rome in the worship of the wafer
and of the Virgin, he would still have hesitated to go the full
length of Romish superstition by obliging his nuns to put
their trust in such questionable characters as Gregory VII.,
Thomas à Becket, etc. Yet on page 185 of the above book
they are required to ask Gregory VII. to pray for them, and
on the following page Thomas à Becket is invoked in the
same manner. Who and what these two Romish saints were,
truthful English history abundantly proves.</p>

<p>As the title of the book shows, it is intended to foster
devotion to St. Benedict, to his sister Scholastica, and to
all the other canonized saints of the Benedictine Order.
Now, who canonized these supposed saints? Was it not
Rome?</p>

<p>The first part is entirely devoted to the honouring and invoking
of St. Benedict. Throughout this part we frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
meet with the verse, “Pray for us, O holy Father St. Benedict.”
There are also a number of litanies, in which he is
called upon as being now “placed over the choirs of monks,”
as “the star of the world,” as “the equal of the prophets,”
as “protector of his order,” as “the scourge of devils,” as the
“Abraham of the New Testament,” and is entreated with the
cry, “We beseech thee to hear us.” On page 47 the following
invocation occurs: “Beseeching thee (holy Father St.
Benedict) to be so faithfully present to me at the hour of my
death, as to oppose thyself on every side where thou shalt
see the assaults of the enemy most violently raging against
me, that, being defended by thy presence, I may securely
escape the snares of the enemy, and arrive at the joys of
heaven.”</p>

<p>Similar impieties occur throughout this and the other
parts. Thus, in the part devoted to St. Scholastica, on page
131, we find the following collect: “Mercifully look down
upon Thy family, we beseech Thee, O Lord, through the
merits of Thy blessed Virgin, St. Scholastica; and as by her
prayers Thou didst cause the rain to descend from heaven
deign, through her supplications,” etc. A number of litanies
also occur, in which she is addressed in the most gushing
way, and asked to pray for those who thus address her.</p>

<p>Moreover, this book introduces prayers for the dead.
Thus, on page 165, the versicle, “May the souls of the faithful
departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.”</p>

<p>There are many other superstitious practices contained in
the book, notably the medal of St. Benedict, the wearing of
which is declared on page 223 to be “a constant silent prayer
to God, … that He would have regard to the merits
of our holy Father, and for his sake would extend His own
protection,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Sister Mary Agnes says that the whole of this book, with
the exception of the part on Indulgences, was in constant
use by the nuns under Father Ignatius.</p>

<p>Must not then monasticism be a fostering garden of superstition,
since even those who claim to reject Rome resort
to the same subterfuges as Rome does to fill the void that
must necessarily exist in the aching hearts of all the deluded
followers of monasticism?</p>

<p>The next book, under Appendix B, will appear, if possible,
even more grossly superstitious than the former.—(<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<p class="hanging">“<span class="smcap">The Exercises of Saint Gertrude, Virgin and
Abbess of the Order of St. Benedict.</span>” (London:
Burns &amp; Oates.)</p>

<p>In the preface a short account is given of the life of St.
Gertrude, which is chiefly a legendary history, and made up
of some of the most absurd and ridiculous tales.</p>

<p>“Once, when she was pouring out her whole heart in love
to its Divine Spouse, it received the impression of the five
wounds of the Divine Redeemer, and Gertrude felt them
continually to the moment of her death with an ever-increasing
anguish and love.”</p>

<p>Again, “On another occasion, on the Feast of Annunciation,
the Mother of God fastened on her breast a heavenly
jewel, wherein were seven precious stones.”</p>

<p>Again, we have another still more extraordinary miracle
vouchsafed to her; for “once she received in her heart the
Divine Infant, who sprang from his crib to attach himself
to her.”</p>

<p>Must not such teaching as this be in the highest degree
degrading? And must not those who can swallow such
stuff be spiritually demented?</p>

<p>It is almost needless to point out that Saint Gertrude is
said to have been devoted to the worship of the Virgin
Mary. We find the following most blasphemous words on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the subject: “The love of Gertrude towards Mary was in
proportion to the tenderness with which the Mother of God
regarded the dearest of the Spouses of her Son. Gertrude
has bequeathed to us the expression of her devotion to the
glorious Queen of heaven in that exquisite prayer which so
expressively reveals the deep and touching character of her
piety: ‘Hail, fair lily of the effulgent and ever-glorious
Trinity! Hail, radiant rose of heavenly fragrance, of whom
the King of heaven willed to be born, and with thy milk to
be fed, feed our soul with thy Divine insinuations!’” I will
only give the last prayer in the book to show how the invocation
of supposed saints is inculcated, as in the other book
so commonly used in monastic and conventual institutions.</p>

<p>“O God, who hast prepared for Thyself a dwelling-place
of delights in the most pure heart of the blessed Virgin
Gertrude, deign, we beseech Thee, through her merits and
intercession, to wipe away all stains from our hearts, that
they may become meet abodes of Thy Divine Majesty,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen!”—(<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Review of “Visits to the Most Holy Sacrament
and the Blessed Virgin Mary. By St. Alphonsus
Liguori.”</span> (Published by Burns &amp; Oates.)</p>

<p>This book was sent to me by Sister Agnes, who wrote
as follows when forwarding it:</p>

<p>“I send the book which we used daily. It was my constant
friend for years; my troubles and sorrows I confided
to it. The hymns with the word ‘Ignatius’ at the end
are his, but not the others; the writing in the first part
of the book, written in MS. on foreign note paper, is
taken from St. Alphonsus Liguori, and <em>was approved of by
Ignatius</em>, except the part I have covered over: that he did
not approve of. It treats of sinful obedience. I cannot quite
make it out. The book it is culled from is, I think, entitled
‘The Religious Life.’”</p>

<p>Before reviewing the book itself, I purpose to place before
you a part of the matter “written on foreign note paper,”
and stuck carefully into the book, acting as a kind of preface
to it, as we may say.</p>

<p>Remember this matter is <em>taken from St. Alphonsus
Liguori’s “Life of the Religious.”</em></p>

<p>“<em>There is no consecration so profound, so entire as that of
‘religious’</em> on the day of their profession, because there is
<em>none so purifying, so constant, or so religious</em>. The consecration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of bishops and priests is more exalted, as being a
Sacrament; it is more noble, as conferring a more sublime
dignity and ineffable character; yea, it is more powerful,
because it imparts to a mere creature some of the powers of
God. <em>But it is not so complete as the monastic</em> consecration,
because it does not include a man’s entire separation from
himself and from the world; it is not so entire, because it
does not <em>absolutely consume the liberty</em>, the independence,
and the spontaneousness of his nature: it is a great sacrifice
and a great Sacrament, but <em>not a</em> <span class="smcapuc">TRUE HOLOCAUST</span>.”</p>

<p>I would urge my readers to stay a moment and mark
carefully, and inwardly digest this description of a nun’s
life. Where is the liberty that is so vainly spoken of? Are
we not here told that a nun by her profession has her
liberty absolutely consumed; that is to say, she is a <em>prisoner
for life</em>?</p>

<p>Notice, I pray you, the words “it is a true holocaust.” In
fact, the sin of the children of Israel, who “caused their sons
to pass through the fire,” is committed over again. As king
Manasseh “caused his children to pass through the fire in
the valley of the son of Hinnom,” so under the pretence of
offering the nuns to the service of God, the Roman Catholics,
and alas! members of the Church of England, “sacrifice
their sons and daughters to devils” (Ps. cvi. 37). It is
nothing but Moloch worship over again. But to proceed
with Liguori’s description of the life of the religious:</p>

<p>“The violation of the vows is then a very grievous sin
against the virtue of religion—(it is) <em>the crime of sacrilege</em>.
Man, consecrated to God and to His service, <em>becomes something
divine</em>; he owes himself, therefore, a religious respect,
which rebounds ever to God; and if ever he should dishonour
by mortal sin the virtues of poverty, obedience, and virginity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of which he has made profession, he would commit an outrage
against the Divine honour, he would be guilty of sacrilege.
What rashness! what crime! what impiety would it
not be then in you to violate your vows!</p>

<p>“The infidelity of consecrated persons is more awful than
the sacrilege committed against holy places, Eucharist
vessels, holy pictures, or relics. Your soul would shudder
at the mere thought of a desecrated temple, a dishonoured
ciborium, a broken crucifix, or of a saint’s body cast into the
flames: would it then consent to far more horrible <em>crimes</em>,
or to more infamous violations? Virginity derives not its
nobility and worth from itself, but rather because it is an
offering to the Lord, inspired and preserved by prudence
and piety of the soul.</p>

<p>“If it should happen that a religious, in drawing comparison
between his life and that of Christians in the world,
should be seized with a holy fear lest he be less zealous, less
pure, or less fervent than many of them, he may still find
a legitimate reassurance in the thought that his actions,
though they may be apparently less virtuous and brilliant,
derive, notwithstanding, greater value and more real devotion
than theirs from the virtue of religion, which is their
chief source, and which has so high a place amongst the
more virtuous.”</p>

<p>Do we not see here how a nun is taught to meet what
must be an oft-recurring thought—that her life is utterly
useless, and that she is unable to devote herself actively to
the service of God, and that misery and unhappiness surround
her, and that she cannot be so pure as many who,
living in the world, are not shut up, so to speak, with only
their own heart’s corruptions to brood over. She is taught
that all these serious failings are more than atoned for by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the mere fact that she has made a solemn profession of
poverty, chastity, and obedience. But to proceed.</p>

<p>“He may be consoled that he has eternally consecrated
to the Lord the root of his actions in such a way that they
all bear the threefold character of a profound religion, ardent
generosity (?), and eternal attachment to that which is good.
We may reasonably suppose that on its entrance into religion,
by making profession of the vows, <em>the Christian soul
obtains remission of all its sins</em>. Not that the religious profession,
considered in itself, possesses a sacramental virtue,
operating by its own intrinsic and independent office, or that
it can, like baptism and penance, blot out the stain of sin;
but if it be sincere, it is a most excellent act of perfect
charity, which unites us very closely to God, by an effectual
outpouring of His sanctifying grace, and by an abundant
remission of those temporal punishments which remain due
to sin after its guilt has been forgiven.</p>

<p>“Before dismissing this noble subject of religious profession
let us not omit to observe that the <em>vow of obedience is its chief
feature</em>. That which is done by obedience is more agreeable
to God than that which is performed by one’s own will.
Your Superior is like a sacred vessel wherein God has placed
for us all His desires and graces, and the true proof of
religious sanctity, the sure token of perfection, is the perfection
of <em>obedience</em> to all Superiors.</p>

<p>“Need we add that obedience has its limits. There are,
firstly, things forbidden by the <em>law of God</em>, which a Superior
cannot prescribe without injustice, since, being then no longer
subordinate to the Divine will, he can no longer serve as a
medium between him and his subject. They are without
the pale of obedience, and the Superior has no authority to
enforce them. The subject, therefore, is not to act contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to the law of God, or to the rule which they profess to
follow; in such obedience would be <em>illicit</em>.”</p>

<p>I must make a few observations on this matter of obedience.
Notice how, by such an obedience, a professed nun
(or monk) transfers to an erring mortal the whole responsibility
of her actions. She has to find out God’s will through
the Superior’s. The Superior is to her in the place of God,
and practically his law and order becomes for her God’s law
and order. How can she remonstrate, when the Superior
commands what is against the law of God, when she has
been taught that she can only learn what is God’s law
through the medium of the Superior? And if she dared to
resist her Superior’s will because she felt it to be leading her
astray, do you suppose that the Superior would ever acknowledge
himself or herself to be in the wrong? And is it
likely that the poor nun would escape some terrible penance
for daring to doubt the propriety of any behest?</p>

<p>But the last paragraph, commencing “Need we add that
obedience has its limits,” and closing with “Such obedience
would be illicit,” was carefully hidden, for Father Ignatius
had told his nuns to <em>paste a piece of paper over it</em>, since he
<em>could not agree</em> with the Romish doctor! He required an
absolute and unconditional obedience, and believed it impossible
for a Superior to prescribe any law that was against
the law of God.</p>

<p>St. Alphonsus Liguori has always been considered an
extreme exponent of Romish doctrines; but now we find a
man holding orders in the Church of England going even
beyond Liguori. I beg my readers to make a special note
of this. I will now finish my extracts from the writing on
foreign note-paper inserted in the book I am about to
review.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“The religious is a person consecrated <em>for ever</em> to the
divine service” (mark this “<em>for ever</em>”—a prisoner for life,
my friends, nothing more or less), “and who cannot disgrace
his high dignity without committing sacrilege. He has
solemnly vowed that he will belong to no other but God; he
has devoted himself to follow after eternal wisdom in order
to become perfect, and the religious, in sinning, has stripped
himself of his justice and merits and become a shameful
ruin, a horrid corpse.”</p>

<p>(This is enough to frighten a poor, timid girl, and to bind
her in chains to her prison.)</p>

<p>“The spiritual dangers of the religious life are not to be
attributed to the vows, but rather to the fault, of him who, by
changing his mind, transgresses those vows. Do not then,
under the pressure of <em>most cruel temptations</em>”—(who makes
them cruel? Read the experiences of Miss Povey or any
other nun who has had the good fortune to escape, or to be
turned out of her prison, and you will find out)—“regret the
profession you have made in the <em>fulness of liberty</em>”—(remember
that previous to profession the Superiors have cunningly
woven their entangling web around the nun, and the
profession may be compared to the spider, after he has
secured his prey, <em>carrying the poor helpless fly</em> into the inner
precincts of his home)—“but rather behave the more diligently
to subject your impatient nature to so <em>salutary</em> a
yoke.” Mark the word “salutary.” Is it not a well-attested
fact that many nuns go mad from the unnatural confinement
within convent walls?</p>

<p>I can only hope to give a very short review of this book,
which was placed in the hands of a nun who was a member
of the Church of England. I have not time for an elaborate
or lengthy account of its contents. I do not think that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
was only at Llanthony that this book was used, and it is to
be feared that whilst the Feltham convent is now no longer
under the wing of Father Ignatius, yet that, with the exception
of unconditional obedience, the teaching there is as
extreme and as Romish as at Llanthony, and yet I believe
a clergyman, holding a licence to officiate in the diocese of
London, acts as chaplain there. How long our bishops
are going to allow and wink at this state of things, I know
not! May God raise up many faithful men who will
demand that the laws of our Protestant Church be complied
with!</p>

<p>The above work is one of the so-called devotional books
prescribed by Father Ignatius, to be used by the nuns under
his control.</p>

<p>It is a Roman Catholic publication, in constant use in all
the monastic and other institutions of that Church; was
composed in Italian by Liguori, the founder of the Redemptorist
Order, translated into English by the Rev. R. A. Coffin,
a member of that order, and published by Burns &amp; Oates,
the leading Romish publishers in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The nature of this book may be readily ascertained from
the fact that it presupposes the consecrated wafer to be
really and truly Christ himself, and that it insists upon the
Virgin Mary as being the Saviour of every one that is
saved. For, in the beginning of the introduction, Liguori
says:</p>

<p>“Our holy faith teaches us, and we are bound to believe,
that in the consecrated host Jesus Christ is really present
under the species of bread”; and, further on, speaking of
the visits to the Virgin, he says:</p>

<p>“The opinion of St. Bernard is well known and generally
believed. It is that God dispenses no graces otherwise than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
through the hands of Mary.… Hence, Father Suarez
declares that it is now the sentiment of the universal Church
that ‘the intercession of Mary is not only useful, but even
necessary to obtain graces,’” and he concludes:</p>

<p>“Do you then be also careful to always join to your daily
visit to the most blessed Sacrament a visit to the most holy
Virgin Mary in some church, or at least before a devout
image of her in your own house.”</p>

<p>Hence on page 25 we find a prayer to the Virgin, beginning
with the words:</p>

<p>“Most holy immaculate Virgin, and my mother ‘Mary,’”
in which she is styled the “queen of the world,” “the hope,
the refuge of sinners,” and the following blasphemous expressions
are used:</p>

<p>“I worship thee, O great queen, and I thank thee for all
the graces which thou hast hitherto granted me; and especially
I thank thee for having delivered me from hell,
which I have so often deserved.… I place all my
hopes in thee, and I confide my salvation to thy care, etc.”</p>

<p>Hence throughout the book occur such expressions as the
following:</p>

<p>“Sole refuge of sinners, have mercy on me.” “O Mary,
grant me the grace always to have recourse to thee.” “Hail,
our hope.” “My hope, help me.” “Therefore, my lady,
and my hope, if thou dost not help me, I am lost.” “All
who are saved obtain salvation through thee; thou then, O
Mary, hast to save me,” and the like.</p>

<p>Extracts might be piled upon extracts, but enough have
been given to show the nature and tendency of the book.
Yet this book the nuns, under Father Ignatius’s jurisdiction,
are induced to keep as a constant companion.</p>

<p>It does not seem necessary to say anything further on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
head of this book: for its antichristian nature must be
apparent to all students of the pure word of God. In Christ
alone is salvation, and He alone is our Mediator between
God and man.—(<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

edited, with English translation and explanatory notes, by a
monk of St. Benedict’s Abbey, Fort Augustus, occur these
words, which show that the rules which regulate the convents
connected with this Order are very similar to those
regulating the monasteries of the same order in the Church
of Rome:</p>

<p>“By no means let a monk be allowed to receive, either
from his parents, or any one else, or from his brethren,
letters, tokens, or any gifts whatsoever, or to give them to
others, without permission of the abbot. And if anything
be sent to him, even by his parents, let him not presume to
receive it, until it hath been made known to the abbot. <em>But
even if the abbot order it to be received, it shall be in his
power to bid it to be given to whom he pleaseth, and let not
the brother to whom it may have been sent be grieved, lest
occasion be given to the devil. Should any one, however,
presume to act otherwise, let him be subjected to the discipline
of the Rule</em>” (p. 155).—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> John Berchmans was the son of a master shoemaker
named John Charles Berchmans, and was born in the year
1599. His biographers tell us that as a child he grew up as
gentle and guileless as a lamb, and early shared his time
between the school and the altar.</p>

<p>When about fifteen years of age, he joined the Society of
Jesus, although his parents were somewhat opposed to his
taking this step. In a letter to his mother at that time he
tried to bring his parents to be reconciled to his taking this
step; he wrote, “God is now pleased, after much prayer, out
of His goodness to give me a vocation to religion and to the
‘Society of Jesus,’ <em>the hammer of all heresies, the vessel of
virtue and perfection</em>. I hope you will not be so unreasonable
as to oppose Him, but as (as I have read in history,)
the Egyptians offered their children to the crocodile, which
they looked upon as a god, and, while it was eating them up,
the parents made high festival, <em>so too, I hope you will rejoice
as they did</em>, and praise God, and thank Him that your son
should be found worthy,” etc.</p>

<p>This Jesuit saint seems to have been “<em>celebrated for devotion
to His Lord in the blessed Sacrament</em>” and <em>devotion to
the Virgin Mary</em>. He was looked upon as a “<em>portent of holiness</em>.”
He is said “<em>to have preserved unstained by grievous
sin the white robe of baptism</em>.” He died in the year 1621.
At eight o’clock on Friday, Aug. 13th, 1621, with “<em>his eyes on
his crucifix</em>,” and with “<em>the holy names of Jesus</em> and <em>Mary
on his lips he went to his reward</em>.”</p>

<p>Miracles of course were said to be wrought through
his relics. In 1865, Pius IX. published the decree for his
beatification, and on Jan. 15th, 1888, Leo XIII., amidst the
splendid festivities of his sacerdotal jubilee, solemnly canonized
him as a saint.—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The late Rev. Dr. Pusey recommended Ritualistic
Father Confessors to give the following advice to those
Sisters of Mercy who might happen to be their penitents:
“I would have great respect paid in confession to your confessor,
for (to say nothing of the honour due to the priesthood)
we ought to look upon them <em>as angels</em> sent by God
to reconcile us to His Divine goodness; and also as His
lieutenants upon earth, and therefore we owe them all reverence,
even though they may <em>at times</em> betray that they are
<em>human</em>, and have human infirmities, and perhaps <em>ask curious
questions</em> which are not part of the confession, such as your
name, what penances or virtues you practise, what are your
temptations, etc. <em>I would have you answer</em>, although you
are not obliged to do so.” (“Manual for Confessors,” p. 190.
London, 1878.) Heaven help the poor sisters who have to
answer the “curious questions” of an inquisitive or wicked
Father Confessor.—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The following is an extract from a lecture delivered by
Mr. W. Walsh, at Bath, reported in the <cite>English Churchman</cite>,
Nov. 26, 1886:</p>

<p>“He (Mr. Walsh) had now to direct attention to the Vow
of ‘<em>Obedience</em>,’ taken by many Ritualistic Sisters of Mercy.
The rule as to ‘obedience’ varied considerably. In <em>Dr.
Pusey’s sisterhood</em>, it was <em>very objectionable indeed</em>. The
rule of holy obedience commands the sisters: ‘Ye shall
ever address the spiritual Mother with honour and respect;
avoid speaking of her among yourselves; cherish and obey
her with holy love, <em>without any murmur or sign of hesitation
or repugnance</em>, but simply, cordially, and promptly obey
with cheerfulness, <span class="smcapuc">AND BANISH FROM YOUR MIND ANY
QUESTION AS TO THE WISDOM OF THE COMMAND GIVEN
YOU</span>. If ye fail in this, ye have failed to resist a temptation
of the evil one.’</p>

<p>“Would not such a rule as this, Mr. Walsh continued to
say, if placed in the hands of a wicked Mother Superior, lead
to the most fearful results? In Father Benson’s ‘Religious
Life Portrayed for the Use of Sisters of Mercy,’ the teaching
was, if possible, placed in a still more fearful light. In that
book the sister is taught that—</p>

<p>“‘A <i lang="fr">religieuse</i> has made the sacrifice of her will in taking
the Vow of Obedience. She is no more her own, but God’s;
and she must obey her Superiors for God’s sake, <em>yielding
herself as wax to be moulded unresistingly</em>.’”</p>

<p>Well did Mr. Walsh observe: “Persons who had to submit
to ‘obedience’ such as this were as truly <em>slaves</em> as any
negro.”—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

necessity of obedience.</p>

<p>In “The Secret Plan of the Jesuits,” by the Abbot Leone,
the following story is told: “Father Saetti, knocking at
my door one morning, according to his custom, I did not
open it. ‘Why this delay?’ he asked me. I replied that
I could not open the door sooner. He then reminded me
that, in all things, the most prompt obedience was the most
perfect; that, in obeying God, we must make every sacrifice,
even that of a moment of time. ‘One of the brethren,’ he
continued, ‘was occupied in writing, when some one knocked
at the door. He had begun to make an “O,” but he did not
stay to finish it. He opened the door, and on returning to
his seat, he found the “O” completed, <em>and all in gold!</em>
Thus you see how God rewards him who is obedient.’” Did
not St. Paul prophesy that those would arise who would
“speak lies in hypocrisy,” and did he not say, “<em>Refuse profane
and old wives’ fables</em>”? (1 Tim. iv. 1-7).—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> While these pages were passing through the press, the
<cite>Western Mail</cite>, of Cardiff, on March 3rd, 1890, published
a report, from the pen of its special correspondent, of the
reception of three new monks at Llanthony Abbey by Father
Ignatius. We reprint this report, slightly abridged:</p>

<p>“The great event at the morning service was the consecration
of three brethren as monks. They were given new
names after their consecration. The abbot gave Cymric
names to the three new monks, naming one Mihangel Dewi
Fair, another Catwg Fair, and the third Dyfrig Fair. The
great organ thundered forth sweetest melody, and the voices
of unseen choristers singing a Welsh chant ushered in the
solemn service. The three monks in reply to the abbot—who
was most gorgeously appareled in cloth of gold and hood,
which caught and held the lights which blazed forth from all
parts of the building—who asked whether it was their wish
to depart, said, ‘We wish to dwell in the House of the Lord
for ever!’ The abbot asked, would they make a solemn
vow of celibacy, obedience, and poverty. That was answered
in the affirmative. After some other ceremonies of the most
gorgeous description had been observed, the three brethren
who sought to be made monks laid themselves down on
their backs on the floor of the church. A funeral pall was
placed over them to signify that they were henceforth dead
to the things of this world. A long wax candle was placed
at each of the four corners of the carpet on which they laid.
This was followed by the Burial Service being performed by
the abbot, and the great bell tolled as if for the dead, and
the <cite>De Profundis</cite> was solemnly chanted. Moving around the
prostrate figures, the abbot, now robed in black vestments,
scattered ashes upon them, and said, ‘Ashes to ashes, and
dust to dust.’ He then sprinkled holy water upon the prostrate
forms. A black curtain was now drawn across the
church, hiding everything from the congregation. Subsequently
that was withdrawn, and it was then seen that the
three monks had commenced their spiritual existence. The
head of each bore the tonsure, and was encircled with a
wreath as described above. The abbot received the three
monks, each of whom held beneath his chin the houseling
white cloth. Later on in the service the abbot, standing in
wedding garments on the steps of the altar, proclaimed the
three new monks as being ‘the spouses of our Lord Jesus
Christ,’ and on the third finger of the left hand of each he
placed a plain wedding ring. After the ceremony of consecration
was over, the three young monks took their seats,
covered with crimson cloth, and thirteen or fourteen nuns,
completely concealed in white wraps, descended from somewhere,
and bowed low, to receive the blessing of the monks.
The above will give the reader some idea of the extraordinary
and gorgeous ritual observed on the occasion.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Probably few people credit what I know to be a fact,
that such instruments of torture are in use in probably all
monastic and conventual institutions. I have by me now
a book called “Priests, Women, and Families,” by J.
Michelet, published in 1874 by the Protestant Evangelical
Mission.</p>

<p>In the editor’s preface to this book there are two sets
of engravings of “Articles of Piety”; or, Instruments of
Torture in English Convents. Under the first set of engravings,
I read thus:</p>

<p>“Instruments of torture are <em>now</em> practised upon nuns in
Romish convents in London, and in all parts of the
country.”</p>

<p>The Romish “Articles of Piety,” named on the next page,
were bought at Little’s Ecclesiastical Warehouse, 20, Cranbourne
Street, and at the convent of the “Sisters of the
Assumption of the Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed
Sacrament.” (London.)</p>

<p>Such instruments of torture are fitter for the worshippers
of Baal, than for the worshippers of God; and a person
using them upon cattle would lay himself open to a prosecution
by the “Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.” Both the parties who purchased these articles
are intimately known to Mr. Robert Steele, the secretary of
the Protestant Evangelical Mission and Electoral Union, 5,
Racquet Court, Fleet Street, E.C.</p>

<p>Christian reader, it is your duty to testify, on God’s
behalf, against the <em>blasphemy</em> and <em>cruelty</em> of Romanism.
The <em>Maker</em> and <em>Preserver</em> of man is the loving <em>Father</em>,
who gave His only begotten Son to die for us, and thus
make atonement for our sin.</p>

<p>The second engraving is headed, “Iron Disciplines of
the Church.” There I read:</p>

<p>“Saint Liguori, the Doctor of the Romish Church” (and
an author strongly recommended to the nuns and monks
under Father Ignatius), “commends the use of <em>Disciplines</em>
to the ‘True Spouse of Christ,’ thus:</p>

<p>“<em>Disciplines</em>, or <em>Flagellations</em>, are a species of mortifications
strongly recommended by St. Francis of Sales, and
universally adopted in religious communities of both sexes.”</p>

<p>Then after a minute description of some fifteen of the
instruments of torture, I read these words:</p>

<p>“Were such cruelties perpetrated upon the <em>heathen</em>, all
our <em>Christian</em> churches would resound with appeals to the
sympathy of the people to come to the help of the sufferers.
This would be commendable. Why, then, is the same
course not adopted on behalf of nuns, who, as Rev. Pierce
Connelly says, ‘are not only slaves, but who are, <i lang="la">de facto</i>,
by a Satanic consecration, secret prisoners for life, and may
any day be put an end to, or much worse, with less risk
of vengeance here in England than in Italy and Spain’?”—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Father Ignatius has himself described this service in his
book entitled “Brother Placidus,” and records, in connection
with it, a wonderful “miracle,” which he declares actually
occurred in his monastery. It is hard to understand how
any person outside a lunatic asylum can believe in such
a “miracle”:—</p>

<p>“Matins were over at five minutes before midnight. A
procession quickly formed in the Refectory; and, as the
hour of joy and gladness struck, the figure of the holy
Child was borne in state to the crib, with lighted tapers,
incense, and chanting—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Ye faithful, approach ye, joyful and triumphant,</div>
<div class="verse">O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The infant figure is lying on its linen swaddling bands, in
the straw; the countless tapers are flaming, amid clouds of
sweetest incense, and shouts of triumph song. The little
figure was charmingly lifelike—the head slightly raised, the
hand also lifted, as if in blessing. In due order all present
approached to kiss the sacred emblems of Incarnate Love.
With long, lighted tapers they approached, and kneeling
down, kissed the upraised hand. First the Abbot; then
Fathers Theodore, Philip, and Drostan; after them Brothers
Pancras, Oswald, Ethelred, and then Placidus. How pale the
fair face of the young novice looks! How his hand is trembling,
as he grasps the burning taper!… The novice
has been longing for this moment—longing to press his burning
lips upon that infant hand—longing to make his adoring
confession of faith in Mary’s little Babe. ‘O my Jesus, my
King, my God, let me come and adore Thee.…’ With
words like these bursting from his heart, but all unheard by
aught save Him for whom they all were uttered, Brother
Placidus knelt to kiss the little hand. ‘Oh! oh!’ burst
from the lips of the children, while the elder brothers fell
involuntarily on their knees. Brother Placidus had kissed
the holy Child, <em>and, as he did so, the figure became animated
with life, and bowed its head, and returned the kiss, and the
little hand had been laid on the novice’s head</em>. The taper
dropped from his hand, and he fell into a deep swoon, on
the floor, before the shrine of the Nativity” (pages 115-118).</p>

of Jesuits into this country and the setting up of monasteries,
and if our Government refuse to listen to the wishes of
thousands in our land for convents to be impartially inspected,
will not the masses, though such a course must be
deplored, ere long feel almost impelled, at least with some
convents, to take the law in their own hands?—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

the Garden of Gethsemane, or the place of the Crucifixion, are conceived in a

in fact, so much changed in mind, body, and state, that it may claim
to be a new history altogether. No one who has tried to peruse the
original compilation will deny that this is an unspeakable advantage
in a once unreadable manual; and, indeed, a ‘manual,’ by its very
name, signifies a work that is meant to hold in the hand and not to
enter the head. The author has carried on his history into the most
recent days. Nothing has escaped his all-seeing eye and his all-recording
pen—neither the Theosophism of Madame Blavatsky, nor
the microscopic heresies of Mr. David Macrae in the United Presbyterian
Church, neither the doings of the Berlin treaty nor of Dr.
Robertson Smith. The annals of the last fifty years on the Continent

<p>“If all sermons were as fresh and unconventional, as simple,
practical, and unaffected as those which he (Rev. Hugh Price
Hughes) has put together under the appropriate title of ‘Social
Christianity,’ there would perhaps be less grumbling from the pew
than is at present the case.”—<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p>“Wise, strong, wholesome, and thoughtful.”—<cite>British Weekly.</cite></p>

<p>“It is not difficult, after reading these fervid, brave, and genial
addresses, to understand the secret of such a preacher’s spell. Mr.
Price Hughes does not mince matters in dealing with the lawlessness,
the Mammon-Worship, and the social disorders of the times; and the
tones in which he speaks are far-reaching and persuasive, because
they are brotherly and full of faith and hope.”—<cite>Leeds Mercury.</cite></p>

<p>“These vigorous sermons are an attempt to show that what must
be called the social failure of Christianity is not the fault of
Christianity or of Christ, but rather the result of Christians having
been selfishly individualistic. The great evils of our day, and
especially those of our own country, are brought to view with much
directness, and the duties and responsibilities of disciples of Christ
are enforced with plainness and power. Whether the subject be
social distress, the administration of justice, Christ’s authority, or the
problem of unbelief, we find these pages uniformly practical and in a
high degree instructive.”—<cite>Christian.</cite></p>

<p>“These sermons are full of good, manly, vigorous teaching of a
stout, practical kind.”—<cite>Star.</cite></p>

way first-class book has not fallen into my hands. Everybody ought to read it.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Opinions of the Press.</span></p>

<p>“A more fascinating and thrilling bit of Missionary history has seldom been
given to the public.”—<cite>Christian.</cite></p>

<p>“Intensely interesting; indeed, often quite fascinating.”—<cite>Christian Leader.</cite></p>

<p>“Let the people who tell us that the romance of missions is passed, read
this manly and thrilling narrative.… No fiction can exercise a stronger
spell than the story of this brave Cameronian missionary’s life.”—<cite>Baptist
Magazine.</cite></p>

<p>“The story of Mr. Paton’s years of residence among the Tannese, amid
many perils and great discouragements, is quite as fascinating in some parts
as many a romance. The author, indeed, seems to have passed through
dangers and difficulties which it would be hard to believe were the veracity of
the writer not beyond question.… An autobiography recording the life and
work of a missionary in some respects not unlike his great prototype—David
Livingstone.”—<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p>“He has a story to tell that is well worth hearing, and that at not a few
stages will compare handsomely with most books of adventure.”—<cite>Scottish
Leader.</cite></p>

<p>“We recommend it to all our missionary societies as a most convincing
testimony to the value of Gospel work among the heathen.”—<cite>Methodist Times.</cite></p>

<p>“Simplicity and godly sincerity are stamped on every page.”—<cite>Leeds
Mercury.</cite></p>

<p>“This is a book far beyond our praise. It will take its place with the
classics of missions—with the Lives of Brainerd and Martyn, and the other
records which will endure as long as Christ is preached. Great as has been
the missionary work accomplished by the author, we believe it will be found
in the end that his greatest work has been the writing of this volume. It is a
book which cannot be read without indescribable emotion.… It must surely,
now and in days to come, kindle in many souls something of the writer’s own
lofty and fervent love. More than any argument it will silence the faithless
clamour against missions; and no one, Christian or sceptic, will peruse it
without feeling that there is amongst us still at least one truly Apostolic man.”—<cite>British

It is perhaps superfluous to say that his work is characterized by great reverence

statement of theology which is the life of the writer. In the more strictly theological
part the summary is, as a rule, arranged and expressed excellently.”</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">M. F. Clare Cusack</span>, “The Nun of Kenmare.”</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p class="center">NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>“Miss Cusack has a great deal to reveal, and she speaks with no
hesitating sound. The book before us is something more than a
revelation to the Protestant world; it is also a controversial treatise,
in popular form, in which the doctrinal errors of the Papacy are
considered from the highest standpoint—the written Word of God.
It is a book which should find a place on every Protestant family’s
bookshelves.”—<cite>English Churchman.</cite></p>

<p>“Deserves to receive the earnest consideration of all who have any
care whatever for the welfare of their country. More than anything
else its pages ought to open the eyes of the ritualists.”—<cite>City Press.</cite></p>

<p>“We are not aware that there has been published any work which
has exposed the inner life and working of the Roman Church as does
the present volume. It is surprising to see what a keen insight Miss
Cusack has into the whole Romish system—political, social, and
literary.”—<cite>Rock.</cite></p>

<p>“This most interesting, important, and even sensational book.…
We heartily commend it, and thank most heartily the talented authoress
for her faithfulness in revealing the hidden evils of Romanism.”—<cite>Protestant Observer.</cite></p>

<p>“Some of the instances related by Miss Cusack are heartrending.
The Romish Church to-day, as ever, is built on lies, forgeries, shameless
misrepresentations of history and the positions of opponents, and
suppressions of the truth.”—<cite>Christian World.</cite></p>

<p>“If there be any belated Protestant in the present day who thinks
that the Papal Apostasy is a branch of the true Church of Christ, and
that it is capable of being used by God as an instrument for the elevation
of mankind, we would advise him to read the Nun of Kenmare’s
new book. Miss Cusack, like many others, was beguiled for a season,
but painful experience opened her eyes to the true nature of this
cleverly devised, but corrupt and tyrannical organisation. It is clear
from her recital that the continued existence of Popery as a religious
(or rather, irreligious) system, rests on the dense ignorance of its
votaries. Even a slight knowledge of revealed truth would be fatal
to the pretensions of the Papacy. The author tells us that the best
educated of Roman Catholics are entirely ignorant of the Bible. The
great duty of the hour is to enlighten these unhappy people as to the
true nature of the system that enslaves them. Under the circumstances,
that is no easy task, but we are hopeful that it is being
gradually accomplished; and Miss Cusack’s book would go far to
bring it about if the mass of Romanists could have the opportunity
of reading it.”—<cite>Christian.</cite></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
